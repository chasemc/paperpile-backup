                   task with applications ranging from drug design to
                   friendship recommendation in social networks. The primary
                   challenge in this domain is finding a way to represent, or
                   encode, graph structure so that it can be easily exploited
                   by machine learning models. Traditionally, machine learning
                   approaches relied on user-defined heuristics to extract
                   features encoding structural information about a graph
                   (e.g., degree statistics or kernel functions). However,
                   recent years have seen a surge in approaches that
                   automatically learn to encode graph structure into
                   low-dimensional embeddings, using techniques based on deep
                   learning and nonlinear dimensionality reduction. Here we
                   provide a conceptual review of key advancements in this area
                   of representation learning on graphs, including matrix
                   factorization-based methods, random-walk based algorithms,
                   and graph neural networks. We review methods to embed

                   representation of each node with a singular feature vector,
                   potentially overlooking intricate details about individual

                   AMPNet through extensive benchmarking on real-world
                   biological systems such as fMRI brain activity recordings
                   and spatial genomic data, improving over existing baselines

  abstract = "Fungi or bacteria that produce secondary metabolites often have
              the potential to bring up various compounds from a single strain.
              The molecular basis for this well-known observation was confirmed
              in the last few years by several sequencing projects of different
              microorganisms. Besides well-known examples about induction of a
              selected biosynthesis (for example, by high- or low-phosphate
              cultivation media), no overview about the potential in this field
              for finding natural products was given. We have investigated the
              systematic alteration of easily accessible cultivation parameters
              (for example, media composition, aeration, culture vessel,
              addition of enzyme inhibitors) in order to increase the number of
              secondary metabolites available from one microbial source. We
              termed this way of revealing nature's chemical diversity the
              'OSMAC (One Strain-Many Compounds) approach' and by using it we
              were able to isolate up to 20 different metabolites in yields up
              to 2.6 g L(-1) from a single organism. These compounds cover
              nearly all major natural product families, and in some cases the
              high production titer opens new possibilities for semisynthetic
              methods to enhance even more the chemical diversity of selected
              compounds. The OSMAC approach offers a good alternative to
              industrial high-throughput screening that focuses on the active
              principle in a distinct bioassay. In consequence, the detection
              of additional compounds that might be of interest as lead
              structures in further bioassays is impossible and clearly
              demonstrates the deficiency of the industrial procedure.
              Furthermore, our approach seems to be a useful tool to detect
              those metabolites that are postulated to be the final products of
              an amazing number of typical secondary metabolite gene clusters
              identified in several microorganisms. If one assumes a (more or
              less) defined reservoir of genetic possibilities for several
              biosynthetic pathways in one strain that is used for a highly
              flexible production of secondary metabolites depending on the
              environment, the OSMAC approach might give more insight into the
              role of secondary metabolism in the microbial community or during
              the evolution of life itself.",

              (TOF MS) as a tool for microbial characterization, efforts to
              increase the taxonomic resolution of the approach have been made.
              The rapidity and efficacy of the approach have suggested
              applications in counter-bioterrorism, prevention of food
              contamination, and monitoring the spread of antibiotic-resistant
              bacteria. Strain-level resolution has been reported with diverse
              bacteria, using library-based and bioinformatics-enabled
              approaches. Three types of characterization at the strain level
              have been reported: strain categorization, strain
              differentiation, and strain identification. Efforts to enhance
              the library-based approach have involved sample pre-treatment and
              data reduction strategies. Bioinformatics approaches have
              leveraged the ever-increasing amount of publicly available
              genomic and proteomic data to attain strain-level
              characterization. Bioinformatics-enabled strategies have
              facilitated strain characterization via intact biomarker
              identification, bottom-up, and top-down approaches. Rigorous
              quantitative and advanced statistical analyses have fostered
              success at the strain level with both approaches. Library-based
              approaches can be limited by effects of sample preparation and
              culture conditions on reproducibility, whereas
              bioinformatics-enabled approaches are typically limited to

              attained. Immunological and lectin-based chemistries have shown
              promise to enhance sensitivity and specificity. Whereas the
              limits of the taxonomic resolution of MALDI TOF MS profiling of

  abstract = "For most proteins in the genome databases, function is predicted
              via sequence comparison. In spite of the popularity of this
              approach, the extent to which it can be reliably applied is
              unknown. We address this issue by systematically investigating
              the relationship between protein function and structure. We focus
              initially on enzymes functionally classified by the Enzyme
              Commission (EC) and relate these to by structurally classified
              domains the SCOP database. We find that the major SCOP fold
              classes have different propensities to carry out certain broad
              categories of functions. For instance, alpha/beta folds are
              disproportionately associated with enzymes, especially
              transferases and hydrolases, and all-alpha and small folds with
              non-enzymes, while alpha+beta folds have an equal tendency either
              way. These observations for the database overall are largely true
              for specific genomes. We focus, in particular, on yeast,
              analyzing it with many classifications in addition to SCOP and EC
              (i.e. COGs, CATH, MIPS), and find clear tendencies for
              fold-function association, across a broad spectrum of functions.
              Analysis with the COGs scheme also suggests that the functions of
              the most ancient proteins are more evenly distributed among
              different structural classes than those of more modern ones. For
              the database overall, we identify the most versatile functions,
              i.e. those that are associated with the most folds, and the most
              versatile folds, associated with the most functions. The two most
              versatile enzymatic functions (hydro-lyases and O-glycosyl
              glucosidases) are associated with seven folds each. The five most
              versatile folds (TIM-barrel, Rossmann, ferredoxin, alpha-beta
              hydrolase, and P-loop NTP hydrolase) are all mixed alpha-beta
              structures. They stand out as generic scaffolds, accommodating
              from six to as many as 16 functions (for the exceptional
              TIM-barrel). At the conclusion of our analysis we are able to
              construct a graph giving the chance that a functional annotation
              can be reliably transferred at different degrees of sequence and

               booming and even dazzling scientific developmental era, the

              genusPaederus, is quantified in individual specimens ofP.
              fuscipes andP. riparius. Whereas males always contain only small
              quantities of the toxin (0.1-1.5 µg), females are not so
              restricted (0.2-20.5 µg) and in most cases possess roughly
              10-fold that in males. There are, however, females containing as
              little pederin as the males, and so two clearly separate groups
              of females can be discerned. These two groups hint at two types
              of females defined by the eggs they lay. About 85\% of the
              females, i.e., those containing much of the substance, transfer
              pederin into every egg and thus are denoted (+)-females. The
              remaining 15\%, the (-)-females, contain at best small amounts of
              the toxin, which is transferred in minute quantities into the
              first eggs while the subsequent ones lack pederin. With respect
              to the pederin content of their eggs, there is no overlap between
              these two types of females. If fed with pederin, (-)-females can
              transfer it into the eggs like (+)-females. After hatching the
              larvae store pederin when present. Larvae are not able to
              biosynthesize the toxin on their own, but storage of that
              received in the egg is very efficient, and the difference between
              larvae with and without pederin is preserved until imaginal
              eclosion. In (+)-females, pederin increases, probably reflecting
              a biosynthetic capacity, but in males and presumptive (-)-females
              the amount of pederin never exceeds the quantity transferred by
              parental (+)-females. Consequently, males and (-)-females
              probably are unable to biosynthesize pederin. This polymorphism
              of females may have a genetic basis. Individuals of all stages
              nevertheless sequester pederin if it is supplied with the diet.",

              sequences showed that the bacterial community structure was
              highly diverse with representatives of the high G + C

              environments, including in association with other sponges.
              Overall, 300 bacterial isolates were cultivated, and a total of
              62 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were identified from these
              isolates by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP)
              analysis and DNA sequencing of the 16S rRNA genes. Approximately
              1,000 16S rRNA gene clones were obtained by the
              cultivation-independent method. A total of 310 clones were
              randomly selected for RFLP analysis, from which 33 OTUs were
              acquired by further DNA sequencing and chimera checking. A total
              of 12 cultured OTUs (19.4\% of the total cultured OTUs) and 13
              uncultured OTUs (39.4\% of the total uncultured OTUs) had low
              sequence identity ($\leq$97\%) with their closest matches in

              evidence for the presence of a diverse variety of unidentified
              bacteria in the marine sponge G. carnosa. A relatively high
              proportion of the isolates exhibited antimicrobial activity, and
              the deferred antagonism assay showed that over half of the active
              isolates exhibited a much stronger bioactivity when grown on
              medium containing seawater. In addition to demonstrating that the
              sponge-associated bacteria could be a rich source of new
              biologically active natural products, the results may have
              ecological implications. This study expands our knowledge of the

              Despite their global importance and the continuous threat of

              recent years. Natural products, especially the secondary

              the evolution of efficacy, targeting specificity, and toxicity.
              We argue that a deeper understanding of the ecology and evolution

  abstract    = "Gene expression changes in response to diverse environmental
                 stimuli to regulate numerous cellular functions. Genes are
                 expressed into their functional products with the help of
                 messenger RNA (mRNA). Thus, measuring levels of mRNA in cells
                 is important to understand cellular functions. With advances
                 in next-generation sequencing (NGS), the abundance of cellular
                 mRNA has been elucidated via transcriptome sequencing.
                 However, several studies have found a discrepancy between mRNA
                 abundance and protein levels induced by translational
                 regulation, including different rates of ribosome entry and
                 translational pausing. As such, the levels of mRNA are not
                 necessarily a direct representation of the protein levels
                 found in a cell. To determine a more precise way to measure
                 protein expression in cells, the analysis of the levels of
                 mRNA associated with ribosomes is being adopted. With an aid
                 of NGS techniques, a single nucleotide resolution footprint of
                 the ribosome was determined using a method known as Ribo-Seq
                 or ribosome profiling. This method allows for the
                 high-throughput measurement of translation in vivo, which was
                 further analyzed to determine the protein synthesis rate,
                 translational pausing, and cellular responses toward a variety
                 of environmental changes. Here, we describe a simple analysis
                 pipeline for Ribo-Seq in bacteria, so-called simple
                 translatome analysis tool for Ribo-Seq (STATR). STATR can be
                 used to carry out the primary processing of Ribo-Seq data,
                 subsequently allowing for multiple levels of translatome
                 study, from experimental validation to in-depth analyses. A
                 command-by-command explanation is provided here to allow a

              surface or in surface crevices, on the other hand, replacements
              of many different kinds seem to occur without affecting the
              tertiary structure: these include replacement of non-polar by
              polar residues and vice versa. Prolines are confined to the ends
              of helices or to non-helical regions; otherwise their incidence
              in the globins of different species is largely random. If all the
              proline sites observed are plotted along the sequence, they are
              seen to place limits on the possible lengths of helical regions.
              In many instances, serine, threonine, aspartic acid or asparagine
              occupies the first site at the amino end of the helix, followed
              by a proline at the second site. In a protein of unknown
              structure, a regular periodicity of invariant non-polar sites
              might serve to recognize helical regions, and the incidence of
              prolines to define their lengths. A common pattern of non-polar
              sites might also help to identify structurally similar proteins
              with different enzymic function.",

              generation of bioactive leads in drug discovery programs.
              However, one of the major limitations of NP drug discovery
              program is ``rediscovery'' of known compounds, thereby hindering
              the rate of drug discovery efficiency. Therefore, in recent
              years, to overcome these limitations, a great deal of attention
              has been drawn towards understanding the role of microorganisms'
              co-culture in inducing novel chemical entities. Such induction
              could be related to activation of genes which might be silent or
              expressed at very low levels (below detection limit) in
              pure-strain cultures under normal laboratory conditions. In this
              review, chemical diversity of compounds isolated from microbial
              co-cultures, is discussed. For this purpose, chemodiversity has
              been represented as a chemical-structure network based on the
              ``Tanimoto Structural Similarity Index''. This highlights the
              huge structural diversity induced by microbial co-culture. In
              addition, the current trends in microbial co-culture research are
              highlighted. Finally, the current challenges (1 - induction
              monitoring, 2 - reproducibility, 3 - growth time effect and 4 -
              up-scaling for isolation purposes) are discussed. The information
              in this review will support researchers to design microbial
              co-culture strategies for future research efforts. In addition,

              regulatory protein (SARP) family, is a global regulator of
              secondary metabolism in Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2). AfsR
              consists of three major functional domains: an N-terminal SARP
              domain, a central ATPase domain, and a C-terminal tetratrico
              peptide repeat (TPR) domain. Two truncated AfsR proteins,
              AfsRDeltaTPR containing the SARP and ATPase domains and
              AfsRDeltaC containing only the SARP domain, exhibited the same
              DNA-binding specificity as that of full-length AfsR. Two monomers
              bound cooperatively to a direct repeat located eight nucleotides
              5' to the -10 element of the afsS promoter. Both truncated AfsR
              proteins, as well as full-length AfsR, were able to form ternary
              complexes with the afsS promoter and RNA polymerase (RNAP),
              although RNAP alone could not bind to the DNA. The
              DNA-(AfsRDeltaC)(2)-RNAP complex was capable of initiating afsS
              transcription in vitro, indicating that the ATPase and TPR
              domains are dispensable for the basic function of AfsR as a
              transcriptional activator. However, the ATPase domain was
              required to fully compensate for the defect in actinorhodin
              production in an afsR-disrupted mutant, suggesting that the
              ATPase domain exerts a regulatory function on the basic SARP
              domain. Deletion or addition of even a single nucleotide between
              the AfsR-binding site and the -10 element of the afsS promoter
              abolished afsS transcription both in vitro and in vivo,
              indicating that the recruitment of RNAP by AfsR to the correct
              location relative to the -10 element is critical for
              transcriptional activation. Since SARP-binding sites with similar
              direct repeats are located at the same position relative to the
              -10 element of their target promoters as is the afsS binding
              site, the SARP family members presumably activate transcription
              of their targets by recruiting RNAP to the promoter, where a
              ternary DNA-SARP-RNAP complex competent for transcriptional
              initiation is formed.",

              respiration-inhibitory activity against insects due to its
              competitive binding capacity to mitochondrial complex I. The
              biosynthetic pathway of piericidin A1 has been reported in
              Streptomyces piomogeues var. Hangzhouwanensis, while the
              regulatory mechanism remains poorly understood. In this study, a
              Streptomyces antibiotic regulatory protein (SARP) family
              transcriptional regulator PieR was characterized. Genetic
              disruption and complementation manipulations revealed that PieR
              positively regulated the production of piericidin A1. Moreover,
              the overexpression of pieR contributed to the improvement of

              was identified and two 5-nt direct repeat sequences (5'-CCGGA-3')

              Nevertheless the bacterial factors required to colonise these

              epithelial cells. Here the presence of the lpfAO113 gene
              (predicted to encode a major fimbrial subunit) was examined by
              PCR in E. coli of serogroups O157 and O26 isolated from pigs

              derivatives must be synthetized to fully study its effectiveness,
              safety profile, and clinical applications. As native isolates
              only accumulate low amounts of the compound, superior producers
              are needed. The heterologous cell factory S. albidoflavus 4N24,
              previously derived from the cluster-free chassis S. albidoflavus
              Del14, produced 860 $\mu$g L-1 of nybomycin, mainly in the
              stationary phase. A first round of strain development modulated
              expression of genes involved in supply of nybomycin precursors
              under control of the common Perm* promoter in 4N24, but without
              any effect. Subsequent studies with mCherry reporter strains
              revealed that Perm* failed to drive expression during the product
              synthesis phase but that use of two synthetic promoters (PkasOP*
              and P41) enabled strong constitutive expression during the entire
              process. Using PkasOP*, several rounds of metabolic engineering
              successively streamlined expression of genes involved in the
              pentose phosphate pathway, the shikimic acid pathway, supply of
              CoA esters, and nybomycin biosynthesis and export, which more
              than doubled the nybomycin titer to 1.7 mg L-1 in the
              sixth-generation strain NYB-6B. In addition, we identified the
              minimal set of nyb genes needed to synthetize the molecule using
              single-gene-deletion strains. Subsequently, deletion of the
              regulator nybW enabled nybomycin production to begin during the
              growth phase, further boosting the titer and productivity. Based
              on RNA sequencing along the created strain genealogy, we
              discovered that the nyb gene cluster was unfavorably
              downregulated in all advanced producers. This inspired removal of
              a part and the entire set of the four regulatory genes at the
              3'-end nyb of the cluster. The corresponding mutants NYB-8 and
              NYB-9 exhibited marked further improvement in production, and the
              deregulated cluster was combined with all beneficial targets from
              primary metabolism. The best strain, S. albidoflavus NYB-11,
              accumulated up to 12 mg L-1 nybomycin, fifteenfold more than the
              basic strain. The absence of native gene clusters in the host and
              use of a lean minimal medium contributed to a selective
              production process, providing an important next step toward
              further development of nybomycin.",

              drug is counted, irrespective of how many ``biosimilars'' or
              added approvals were subsequently identified. As in the 2012 and
              2016 reviews, we have continued to utilize our secondary
              subdivision of a ``natural product mimic'', or ``NM'', to join
              the original primary divisions, and the designation ``natural
              product botanical'', or ``NB'', to cover those botanical
              ``defined mixtures'' now recognized as drug entities by the FDA
              (and similar organizations). From the data presented in this
              review, the utilization of natural products and/or synthetic
              variations using their novel structures, in order to discover and
              develop the final drug entity, is still alive and well. For
              example, in the area of cancer, over the time frame from 1946 to
              1980, of the 75 small molecules, 40, or 53.3\%, are N or ND. In
              the 1981 to date time frame the equivalent figures for the N*
              compounds of the 185 small molecules are 62, or 33.5\%, though to
              these can be added the 58 S* and S*/NMs, bringing the figure to
              64.9\%. In other areas, the influence of natural product
              structures is quite marked with, as expected from prior
              information, the anti-infective area being dependent on natural
              products and their structures, though as can be seen in the
              review there are still disease areas (shown in Table 2) for which
              there are no drugs derived from natural products. Although
              combinatorial chemistry techniques have succeeded as methods of
              optimizing structures and have been used very successfully in the
              optimization of many recently approved agents, we are still able
              to identify only two de novo combinatorial compounds (one of
              which is a little speculative) approved as drugs in this 39-year
              time frame, though there is also one drug that was developed
              using the ``fragment-binding methodology'' and approved in 2012.
              We have also added a discussion of candidate drug entities
              currently in clinical trials as ``warheads'' and some very
              interesting preliminary reports on sources of novel antibiotics
              from Nature due to the absolute requirement for new agents to
              combat plasmid-borne resistance genes now in the general
              populace. We continue to draw the attention of readers to the
              recognition that a significant number of natural product
              drugs/leads are actually produced by microbes and/or microbial
              interactions with the ``host from whence it was isolated''; thus
              we consider that this area of natural product research should be
              expanded significantly.",

               environments. Describing the intricate chemistry of seawater
               requires optimal in situ sampling. Here is presented a novel
               underwater hand-held solid-phase extraction device, I-SMEL (In
               Situ Marine moleculE Logger), which aims to concentrate diluted
               molecules from large volumes of seawater in a delimited zone
               targeting keystone benthic species. Marine benthic holobionts,
               such as sponges, can impact the chemical composition of their
               surroundings possibly through the production and release of
               their specialized metabolites, hence termed exometabolites
               (EMs). I-SMEL was deployed in a sponge-dominated Mediterranean
               ecosystem at a 15 m depth. Untargeted MS-based metabolomics was
               performed on enriched EM extracts and showed (1) the chemical
               diversity of enriched seawater metabolites and (2) reproducible
               recovery and enrichment of specialized sponge EMs such as
               aerothionin, demethylfurospongin-4, and longamide B methyl

               targeted species: Aplysina cavernicola, Spongia officinalis, and

              availability of these data is preventing the implementation of
              new technologies in natural products science. Specifically,
              development of new computational strategies for compound
              characterization and identification are being hampered by the
              lack of a comprehensive database of known compounds against which

              community-maintained database of microbial natural product
              structures would enable the development of new technologies in
              natural products discovery and improve the interoperability of
              existing natural products data resources. However, these data are
              spread unevenly throughout the historical scientific literature,
              including both journal articles and international patents. These
              documents have no standard format, are often not digitized as
              machine readable text, and are not publicly available. Further,
              none of these documents have associated structure files (e.g.,
              MOL, InChI, or SMILES), instead containing images of structures.
              This makes extraction and formatting of relevant natural products
              data a formidable challenge. Using a combination of manual
              curation and automated data mining approaches we have created a
              database of microbial natural products (The Natural Products
              Atlas, www.npatlas.org) that includes 24 594 compounds and
              contains referenced data for structure, compound names, source
              organisms, isolation references, total syntheses, and instances
              of structural reassignment. This database is accompanied by an
              interactive web portal that permits searching by structure,
              substructure, and physical properties. The Web site also provides
              mechanisms for visualizing natural products chemical space and
              dashboards for displaying author and discovery timeline data.
              These interactive tools offer a powerful knowledge base for
              natural products discovery with a central interface for structure
              and property-based searching and presents new viewpoints on
              structural diversity in natural products. The Natural Products

              all microbial NP-inspired therapies can be traced to field

              importance of these expeditions in the search for new drugs, few

              their corresponding production genes are distributed within a

              datasets, consisting of retention time, m/z, and MS intensity
              features, as a function of hundreds of conditions or elicitors.

              Heterologous expression systems should allow these clusters to be
              expressed and their products obtained, but approaches are needed
              to identify the most valuable target clusters. The inp cluster of
              Aspergillus nidulans contains a gene, inpE, that encodes a
              proteasome subunit, leading us to hypothesize that the inp

              our data allow us to propose a biosynthetic pathway for the

              bacteria represent a fraction of those that exist in the
              environment, and that uncultivated populations in sediment have
              genes that encode for a high diversity of novel natural product
              (NP) biosynthetic enzymes. Quantifying these genes in both
              sediment and cultivatable bacterial populations allows us to
              assess how much diversity is present on nutrient agar and is
              critical to guiding the trajectory of future NP discovery
              platforms. Herein, we employed next-generation amplicon
              sequencing to assess the NP biosynthetic gene populations present
              in two Lake Huron sediment samples, and compared these with
              populations from their corresponding cultivatable bacteria. We
              highlight three findings from our study: (1) after cultivation,
              we recovered between 7.7\% and 23\% of three common types of NP
              biosynthetic genes from the original sediment population; (2)
              between 76.3\% and 91.5\% of measured NP biosynthetic genes from
              nutrient agar have yet to be characterized in known biosynthetic
              gene cluster databases, indicating that readily cultivatable
              bacteria harbor the potential to produce new NPs; and (3) even
              though the predominant taxa present on nutrient media represented
              some of the major producers of bacterial NPs, the sediment
              harbored a significantly greater pool of NP biosynthetic genes
              that could be mined for structural novelty, and these likely
              belong to taxa that typically have not been represented in
              microbial drug discovery libraries.",

              These anthracyclines contain a tetracyclic chromophore which
              intercalates into DNA and a monosaccharide, trisaccharide, and
              two trisaccharide side chains, respectively. These side chains
              consist of between one and three 2,6-dideoxy, 1,4-diaxially
              linked sugars. Three chemical probes, fotemustine, dimethyl
              sulfate, 4-(2'-bromoethyl)phenol, and the enzymic probe DNase I
              were used in the footprinting experiments. The chemical probes
              provided a clear picture of the binding pattern at 37 degrees C
              and more detailed information than that obtained using the
              standard DNase I footprinting assay. All three anthracyclines
              showed preferred binding to 5'-GT-3' sequences in both the
              chemical and enzymatic footprinting. DNase I footprinting showed
              that the number of base pairs of DNA protected from cleavage
              increased with the number of saccharide groups present at
              particular sites and is consistent with DNA binding of the
              saccharide side chains. Alkylation of runs of guanine by
              fotemustine was inhibited by all three anthracyclines, while
              alkylation by dimethyl sulfate was enhanced for most guanines.
              The probe 4-(2'-bromoethyl)phenol showed that all three
              anthracyclines completely protected all of the adenines in the
              minor groove from alkylation, and enhanced major groove guanine
              alkylation was observed with aclacinomycin A, daunomycin, and, to
              a much lesser extent, ditrisarubicin B. These results are
              consistent with intercalation of the aglycone ring and binding of
              the rigid, hydrophobic saccharide side chains in the minor
              groove. Footprinting of four methyl glycosides related to the
              anthracyclines showed no evidence of DNA binding with any of the

                 ET-743 is the product of a marine bacterial symbiont. Using
                 metagenomic sequencing of total DNA from the
                 tunicate/microbial consortium, we targeted and assembled a 35
                 kb contig containing 25 genes that comprise the core of the
                 NRPS biosynthetic pathway for this valuable anticancer agent.
                 Rigorous sequence analysis based on codon usage of two large
                 unlinked contigs suggests that Candidatus Endoecteinascidia
                 frumentensis produces the ET-743 metabolite. Subsequent
                 metaproteomic analysis confirmed expression of three key
                 biosynthetic proteins. Moreover, the predicted activity of an
                 enzyme for assembly of the tetrahydroisoquinoline core of
                 ET-743 was verified in vitro. This work provides a foundation
                 for direct production of the drug and new analogues through
                 metabolic engineering. We expect that the interdisciplinary
                 approach described is applicable to diverse host-symbiont
                 systems that generate valuable natural products for drug
                 discovery and development.",

              why biomimetic molecules, especially those produced by natural
              processes, should deliver in the age of artificial intelligence
              and screening of vast collections both in vitro and in silico.
              The declining natural product-likeness of licensed drugs and the
              consequent physicochemical implications of this trend in the
              context of current practices are noted. To arrest these trends,
              the logic of seeking new bioactive agents with enhanced natural
              mimicry is considered; notably that molecules constructed by
              proteins (enzymes) are more likely to interact with other
              proteins (e.g., targets and transporters), a notion validated by
              natural products. Nature's finite number of building blocks and
              their interactions necessarily reduce potential numbers of
              structures, yet these enable expansion of chemical space with
              their inherent diversity of physical characteristics, pertinent

              purely ``synthetic'' structures. The design and synthesis of

              which uses pederin for chemical defense, these genes belong to an
              as-yet unculturable symbiont closely related to Pseudomonas
              aeruginosa. To study the extremely complex association of T.
              swinhoei and its multispecies bacterial consortium, we used a
              phylogenetic approach that allowed the isolation of
              onnamide/theopederin polyketide synthase genes from an uncultured
              sponge symbiont. Analysis of the biosynthesis genes provided
              unexpected insights into a possible evolution of pederin-type
              pathways. Besides revealing new facets of invertebrate chemical
              ecology, these first gene clusters from uncultivated symbiotic

              nuclei of T. agilis, performed whole-genome amplification, and
              obtained bacterial 16S rRNA genes by PCR. Unexpectedly, however,
              all of the analyzed clones were from pseudogenes of 16S rRNA with
              large deletions and numerous sequence variations even within a
              single-nucleus sample. Authentic 16S rRNA gene sequences were
              finally recovered by digesting the nuclear DNA; these pseudogenes
              were present on the host Trichonympha genome. The authentic
              sequences represented two distinct bacterial species belonging to
              the phylum Verrucomicrobia, and the pseudogenes have originated
              from each of the two species. Fluorescence in situ hybridization
              confirmed that both species are specifically localized, and
              occasionally co-localized, within nuclei of T. agilis.
              Transmission electron microscopy revealed that they are distorted
              cocci with characteristic electron-dense and lucent regions,
              which resemble the intranuclear symbionts illustrated by Kirby.
              For these symbionts, we propose a novel genus and species,
              'Candidatus Nucleococcus trichonymphae' and 'Candidatus
              Nucleococcus kirbyi'. These formed a termite-specific cluster

              detected within nuclei of various gut protists, including both
              parabasalids and oxymonads. We suggest that this group is widely
              distributed as intranuclear symbionts of diverse protists in

              investigate the relationship between human-associated and
              environmental resistomes, we analyzed functional metagenomic
              selections for resistance against 18 clinically relevant
              antibiotics from soil and human gut microbiota as well as a set
              of multidrug-resistant cultured soil isolates. These analyses
              were enabled by Resfams, a new curated database of protein
              families and associated highly precise and accurate profile

               have been used to describe the ecology and evolution of
               macro-organisms, it is less clear to what extent these
               principles account for the extraordinary levels of bacterial
               diversity observed in nature. Ecological interactions among
               bacteria are particularly challenging to address due to
               methodological limitations and uncertainties over how to
               recognize fundamental units of diversity and link them to the
               functional traits and evolutionary processes that led to their
               divergence. Here we show that two closely related marine
               actinomycete species can be differentiated based on competitive
               strategies. Using a direct challenge assay to investigate
               inhibitory interactions with members of the bacterial community,
               we observed a temporal difference in the onset of inhibition.
               The majority of inhibitory activity exhibited by Salinispora
               arenicola occurred early in its growth cycle and was linked to
               antibiotic production. In contrast, most inhibition by
               Salinispora tropica occurred later in the growth cycle and was
               more commonly linked to nutrient depletion or other sources.
               Comparative genomics support these differences, with S.
               arenicola containing nearly twice the number of secondary
               metabolite biosynthetic gene clusters as S. tropica, indicating
               a greater potential for secondary metabolite production. In
               contrast, S. tropica is enriched in gene clusters associated
               with the acquisition of growth-limiting nutrients such as iron.
               Coupled with differences in growth rates, the results reveal
               that S. arenicola uses interference competition at the expense
               of growth, whereas S. tropica preferentially employs a strategy
               of exploitation competition. The results support the ecological
               divergence of two co-occurring and closely related species of
               marine bacteria by providing evidence they have evolved
               fundamentally different strategies to compete in marine

              understanding retroviral integration and V(D)J recombination as
              well as many other DNA transposition reactions. Here we report
              the structure of the Mu transpososome--Mu transposase (MuA) in
              complex with bacteriophage DNA ends and target DNA--determined
              from data that extend anisotropically to 5.2 {\AA}, 5.2 {\AA} and
              3.7 {\AA} resolution, in conjunction with previously determined
              structures of individual domains. The highly intertwined
              structure illustrates why chemical activity depends on formation
              of the synaptic complex, and reveals that individual domains have
              different roles when bound to different sites. The structure also
              provides explanations for the increased stability of the final
              product complex and for its preferential recognition by the
              ATP-dependent unfoldase ClpX. Although MuA and many other
              recombinases share a structurally conserved 'DDE' catalytic
              domain, comparisons among the limited set of available complex
              structures indicate that some conserved features, such as
              catalysis in trans and target DNA bending, arose through
              convergent evolution because they are important for function.",

              billions or trillions of bases can uncover hundreds of microbial
              genomes, but naive assembly of these data is computationally
              intensive, requiring hundreds of gigabytes to terabytes of RAM.
              We present latent strain analysis (LSA), a scalable, de novo
              pre-assembly method that separates reads into biologically
              informed partitions and thereby enables assembly of individual
              genomes. LSA is implemented with a streaming calculation of
              unobserved variables that we call eigengenomes. Eigengenomes
              reflect covariance in the abundance of short, fixed-length
              sequences, or k-mers. As the abundance of each genome in a sample
              is reflected in the abundance of each k-mer in that genome,
              eigengenome analysis can be used to partition reads from
              different genomes. This partitioning can be done in fixed memory
              using tens of gigabytes of RAM, which makes assembly and
              downstream analyses of terabytes of data feasible on commodity
              hardware. Using LSA, we assemble partial and near-complete
              genomes of bacterial taxa present at relative abundances as low
              as 0.00001\%. We also show that LSA is sensitive enough to

                 of gene expression in bacteria. To enable transcriptome-wide
                 mapping of bacterial sRNA-target pairs, we developed RIL-seq
                 (RNA interaction by ligation and sequencing). RIL-seq is an
                 experimental-computational methodology for capturing
                 sRNA-target interactions in vivo that takes advantage of the
                 mutual binding of the sRNA and target RNA molecules to the RNA
                 chaperone protein Hfq. The experimental part of the protocol
                 involves co-immunoprecipitation of Hfq and bound RNAs,
                 ligation of RNAs, library preparation and sequencing. The
                 computational pipeline maps the sequenced fragments to the
                 genome, reveals chimeric fragments (fragments comprising two
                 ligated independent fragments) and determines statistically
                 significant overrepresented chimeric fragments as interacting
                 RNAs. The statistical filter is aimed at reducing the number
                 of spurious interactions resulting from ligation of random
                 neighboring RNA fragments, thus increasing the reliability of
                 the determined sRNA-target pairs. A major advantage of RIL-seq
                 is that it does not require overexpression of sRNAs; instead,
                 it simultaneously captures the in vivo targets of all sRNAs in
                 the native state of the cell. Application of RIL-seq to
                 bacteria grown under different conditions provides distinctive
                 snapshots of the sRNA interactome and sheds light on the
                 dynamics and rewiring of the post-transcriptional regulatory
                 network. As RIL-seq needs no prior information about the sRNA
                 and target sequences, it can identify novel sRNAs, along with
                 their targets. It can be adapted to detect protein-mediated
                 RNA-RNA interactions in any bacterium with a sequenced genome.

              phylogenetic groups. Hence, pangenomes are increasingly used to
              characterize the strain diversity of prokaryotic species. To
              understand the interdependence of pangenome features (such as the
              number of core and accessory genes) and to study the impact of
              environmental and phylogenetic constraints on the evolution of
              conspecific strains, we computed pangenomes for 155
              phylogenetically diverse species (from ten phyla) using 7,000
              high-quality genomes to each of which the respective habitats
              were assigned. Species habitat ubiquity was associated with
              several pangenome features. In particular, core-genome size was
              more important for ubiquity than accessory genome size. In
              general, environmental preferences had a stronger impact on
              pangenome evolution than phylogenetic inertia. Environmental
              preferences explained up to 49\% of the variance for pangenome
              features, compared with 18\% by phylogenetic inertia. This
              observation was robust when the dataset was extended to 10,100
              species (59 phyla). The importance of environmental preferences
              was further accentuated by convergent evolution of pangenome
              features in a given habitat type across different phylogenetic
              clades. For example, the soil environment promotes expansion of
              pangenome size, while host-associated habitats lead to its
              reduction. Taken together, we explored the global principles of
              pangenome evolution, quantified the influence of habitat, and
              phylogenetic inertia on the evolution of pangenomes and

              around 100,000 unique proteins have been determined5, but this
              represents a small fraction of the billions of known protein

              to years of painstaking effort required to determine a single
              protein structure. Accurate computational approaches are needed
              to address this gap and to enable large-scale structural
              bioinformatics. Predicting the three-dimensional structure that a

              structure prediction component of the 'protein folding
              problem'8-has been an important open research problem for more

              fall far short of atomic accuracy, especially when no homologous

              method that can regularly predict protein structures with atomic
              accuracy even in cases in which no similar structure is known. We

  abstract = "Proteins are essential to life, and understanding their structure
              can facilitate a mechanistic understanding of their function.
              Through an enormous experimental effort1-4, the structures of
              around 100,000 unique proteins have been determined5, but this
              represents a small fraction of the billions of known protein
              sequences6,7. Structural coverage is bottlenecked by the months
              to years of painstaking effort required to determine a single
              protein structure. Accurate computational approaches are needed
              to address this gap and to enable large-scale structural
              bioinformatics. Predicting the three-dimensional structure that a
              protein will adopt based solely on its amino acid sequence-the
              structure prediction component of the 'protein folding
              problem'8-has been an important open research problem for more
              than 50 years9. Despite recent progress10-14, existing methods
              fall far short of atomic accuracy, especially when no homologous
              structure is available. Here we provide the first computational
              method that can regularly predict protein structures with atomic
              accuracy even in cases in which no similar structure is known. We
              validated an entirely redesigned version of our neural
              network-based model, AlphaFold, in the challenging 14th Critical
              Assessment of protein Structure Prediction (CASP14)15,
              demonstrating accuracy competitive with experimental structures
              in a majority of cases and greatly outperforming other methods.
              Underpinning the latest version of AlphaFold is a novel machine
              learning approach that incorporates physical and biological
              knowledge about protein structure, leveraging multi-sequence
              alignments, into the design of the deep learning algorithm.",

              routes are known for its insertion into proteins and nucleic
              acids, via selenocysteine and 2-selenouridine, respectively1.
              However, despite its importance, pathways for specific
              incorporation of selenium into small molecules have remained
              elusive. Here we use a genome-mining strategy in various
              microorganisms to uncover a widespread three-gene cluster that
              encodes a dedicated pathway for producing selenoneine, the
              selenium analogue of the multifunctional molecule
              ergothioneine2,3. We elucidate the reactions of all three
              proteins and uncover two novel selenium-carbon bond-forming
              enzymes and the biosynthetic pathway for production of a
              selenosugar, which is an unexpected intermediate en route to the
              final product. Our findings expand the scope of biological
              selenium utilization, suggest that the selenometabolome is more
              diverse than previously thought, and set the stage for the
              discovery of other selenium-containing natural products.",

              important long-read metagenomic assembly challenges, such as
              uneven bacterial composition and intra-species heterogeneity.
              First, we benchmarked metaFlye using simulated and mock bacterial
              communities and show that it consistently produces assemblies
              with better completeness and contiguity than state-of-the-art
              long-read assemblers. Second, we performed long-read sequencing
              of the sheep microbiome and applied metaFlye to reconstruct 63
              complete or nearly complete bacterial genomes within single
              contigs. Finally, we show that long-read assembly of human
              microbiomes enables the discovery of full-length biosynthetic
              gene clusters that encode biomedically important natural
              products.",

                 silent secondary metabolite biosynthetic gene clusters

              tool AMRFinder. Here, we describe the expansion of the Reference
              Gene Database, now called the Reference Gene Catalog, to include
              putative acid, biocide, metal, stress resistance genes, in
              addition to virulence genes and species-specific point mutations.
              Genes and point mutations are classified by broad functions, as
              well as more detailed functions. As we have expanded both the
              functional repertoire of identified genes and functionality, NCBI
              released a new version of AMRFinder, known as AMRFinderPlus. This
              new tool allows users the option to utilize only the core set of
              AMR elements, or include stress response and virulence genes,
              too. AMRFinderPlus can detect acquired genes and point mutations
              in both protein and nucleotide sequence. In addition, the
              evidence used to identify the gene has been expanded to include
              whether nucleotide or protein sequence was used, its location in
              the contig, and presence of an internal stop codon. These
              database improvements and functional expansions will enable
              increased precision in identifying AMR genes, linking AMR
              genotypes and phenotypes, and determining possible relationships
              between AMR, virulence, and stress response.",

              abilities to produce bioproducts that have profound economic and
              societal importance. These bioproducts are produced by metabolic
              pathways including those for the biosynthesis of secondary
              metabolites and catabolism of plant biomass constituents.
              Advancements in genome sequencing technologies have revealed a
              wealth of untapped metabolic potential from Streptomyces genomes.
              Here, we report the largest Streptomyces pangenome generated by
              using 205 complete genomes. Metabolic potentials of the pangenome
              and individual genomes were analyzed, revealing degrees of
              conservation of individual metabolic pathways and strains
              potentially suitable for metabolic engineering. Of them,
              Streptomyces bingchenggensis was identified as a potent degrader
              of plant biomass. Polyketide, non-ribosomal peptide, and
              gamma-butyrolactone biosynthetic enzymes are primarily strain
              specific while ectoine and some terpene biosynthetic pathways are
              highly conserved. A large number of transcription factors
              associated with secondary metabolism are strain-specific while
              those controlling basic biological processes are highly
              conserved. Although the majority of genes involved in
              morphological development are highly conserved, there are
              strain-specific varieties which may contribute to fine tuning the
              timing of cellular differentiation. Overall, these results
              provide insights into the metabolic potential, regulation and

               bacterial taxa are distributed in nature, in addition to the
               degree of variation of SM production within those taxa, is
               critical to informing these front-end discovery efforts and

               genes evolve, but the challenge of analyzing polygenic
               phenotypes has complicated efforts to study how genes evolve
               when they are part of a group that functions collectively. We
               suggest that biosynthetic gene clusters from microbes are ideal
               candidates for the evolutionary study of gene collectives; these
               selfish genetic elements evolve rapidly, they usually comprise a
               complete pathway, and they have a phenotype---a small

              time instead of connecting one molecule to one organism at a
              time, such as how it is traditionally done. We can correlate
              these families through the use of nanospray desorption
              electrospray ionization MS/MS, an ambient pressure MS technique,
              in conjunction with MS/MS networking and peptidogenomics. We
              matched the molecular families of peptide natural products
              produced by 42 bacilli and 18 pseudomonads through the generation
              of amino acid sequence tags from MS/MS data of specific clusters
              found in the MS/MS network. These sequence tags were then linked
              to biosynthetic gene clusters in publicly accessible genomes,
              providing us with the ability to link particular molecules with
              the genes that produced them. As an example of its use, this
              approach was applied to two unsequenced Pseudoalteromonas
              species, leading to the discovery of the gene cluster for a
              molecular family, the bromoalterochromides, in the previously
              sequenced strain P. piscicida JCM 20779(T). The approach itself
              is not limited to 60 related strains, because spectral networking
              can be readily adopted to look at molecular family-gene cluster
              families of hundreds or more diverse organisms in one single
              MS/MS network.",

  abstract = "Access to genome sequence data has challenged traditional natural
              product discovery paradigms by revealing that the products of
              most bacterial biosynthetic pathways have yet to be discovered.
              Despite the insight afforded by this technology, little is known
              about the diversity and distributions of natural product
              biosynthetic pathways among bacteria and how they evolve to
              generate structural diversity. Here we analyze genome sequence
              data derived from 75 strains of the marine actinomycete genus
              Salinispora for pathways associated with polyketide and
              nonribosomal peptide biosynthesis, the products of which account
              for some of today's most important medicines. The results reveal
              high levels of diversity, with a total of 124 pathways identified
              and 229 predicted with continued sequencing. Recent horizontal
              gene transfer accounts for the majority of pathways, which occur
              in only one or two strains. Acquired pathways are incorporated
              into genomic islands and are commonly exchanged within and
              between species. Acquisition and transfer events largely involve
              complete pathways, which subsequently evolve by gene gain, loss,
              and duplication followed by divergence. The exchange of similar
              pathway types at the precise chromosomal locations in different
              strains suggests that the mechanisms of integration include
              pathway-level homologous recombination. Despite extensive
              horizontal gene transfer there is clear evidence of species-level
              vertical inheritance, supporting the concept that secondary
              metabolites represent functional traits that help define
              Salinispora species. The plasticity of the Salinispora secondary
              metabolome provides an effective mechanism to maximize
              population-level secondary metabolite diversity while limiting
              the number of pathways maintained within any individual genome.",

  abstract = "Over the past decade, bacterial genome sequences have revealed an
              immense reservoir of biosynthetic gene clusters, sets of
              contiguous genes that have the potential to produce drugs or
              drug-like molecules. However, the majority of these gene clusters
              appear to be inactive for unknown reasons prompting terms such as
              ``cryptic'' or ``silent'' to describe them. Because natural
              products have been a major source of therapeutic molecules,
              methods that rationally activate these silent clusters would have
              a profound impact on drug discovery. Herein, a new strategy is
              outlined for awakening silent gene clusters using small molecule
              elicitors. In this method, a genetic reporter construct affords a
              facile read-out for activation of the silent cluster of interest,
              while high-throughput screening of small molecule libraries
              provides potential inducers. This approach was applied to two
              cryptic gene clusters in the pathogenic model Burkholderia
              thailandensis. The results not only demonstrate a prominent
              activation of these two clusters, but also reveal that the
              majority of elicitors are themselves antibiotics, most in common
              clinical use. Antibiotics, which kill B. thailandensis at high
              concentrations, act as inducers of secondary metabolism at low
              concentrations. One of these antibiotics, trimethoprim, served as
              a global activator of secondary metabolism by inducing at least
              five biosynthetic pathways. Further application of this strategy
              promises to uncover the regulatory networks that activate silent

              array of cryptic molecules found in bacteria.",

  abstract = "To explore protein space from a global perspective, we consider
              9,710 SCOP (Structural Classification of Proteins) domains with
              up to 70\% sequence identity and present all similarities among
              them as networks: In the ``domain network,'' nodes represent
              domains, and edges connect domains that share ``motifs,'' i.e.,
              significantly sized segments of similar sequence and structure.
              We explore the dependence of the network on the thresholds that
              define the evolutionary relatedness of the domains. At
              excessively strict thresholds the network falls apart completely;
              for very lax thresholds, there are network paths between
              virtually all domains. Interestingly, at intermediate thresholds
              the network constitutes two regions that can be described as
              ``continuous'' versus ``discrete.'' The continuous region
              comprises a large connected component, dominated by domains with
              alternating alpha and beta elements, and the discrete region
              includes the rest of the domains in isolated islands, each
              generally corresponding to a fold. We also construct the ``motif
              network,'' in which nodes represent recurring motifs, and edges
              connect motifs that appear in the same domain. This network also
              features a large and highly connected component of motifs that
              originate from domains with alternating alpha/beta elements (and
              some all-alpha domains), and smaller isolated islands. Indeed,
              the motif network suggests that nature reuses such motifs
              extensively. The networks suggest evolutionary paths between
              domains and give hints about protein evolution and the underlying
              biophysics. They provide natural means of organizing protein
              space, and could be useful for the development of strategies for

              live associated with the marine sponge Theonella swinhoei Y, the
              source of numerous unusual bioactive natural products. Belonging
              to the proposed candidate phylum ``Tectomicrobia,'' Candidatus
              Entotheonella members are only distantly related to any
              cultivated organism. The Ca E. factor has been identified as the
              source of almost all polyketide and modified peptides families
              reported from the sponge host, and both Ca Entotheonella
              phylotypes contain numerous additional genes for as-yet unknown
              metabolites. Here, we provide insights into the biology of these
              remarkable bacteria using genomic, (meta)proteomic, and chemical
              methods. The data suggest a metabolic model of Ca Entotheonella
              as facultative anaerobic, organotrophic organisms with the
              ability to use methanol as an energy source. The symbionts appear
              to be auxotrophic for some vitamins, but have the potential to
              produce most amino acids as well as rare cofactors like coenzyme
              F420 The latter likely accounts for the strong autofluorescence
              of Ca Entotheonella filaments. A large expansion of protein
              families involved in regulation and conversion of organic
              molecules indicates roles in host-bacterial interaction. In
              addition, a massive overrepresentation of members of the
              luciferase-like monooxygenase superfamily points toward an
              important role of these proteins in Ca Entotheonella.
              Furthermore, we performed mass spectrometric imaging combined
              with fluorescence in situ hybridization to localize Ca
              Entotheonella and some of the bioactive natural products in the
              sponge tissue. These metabolic insights into a new candidate

              biosynthesis they encode. Efforts to discover the products of
              these orphan BGCs are driving the development of genome mining
              techniques based on the premise that many are transcriptionally
              silent during normal laboratory cultivation. Here, we employ
              comparative transcriptomics to assess BGC expression among four
              closely related strains of marine bacteria belonging to the genus
              Salinispora The results reveal that slightly more than half of
              the BGCs are expressed at levels that should facilitate product
              detection. By comparing the expression profiles of similar gene
              clusters in different strains, we identified regulatory genes
              whose inactivation appears linked to cluster silencing. The
              significance of these subtle differences between expressed and
              silent BGCs could not have been predicted a priori and was only

              conservation of silent clusters among a larger number of strains

              under different regulatory control from the expressed forms or

              embedding) and uses discrete cosine transforms to compress the
              data to extract the most essential part, significantly reducing
              the data size. This PRotein Ortholog Search Tool (PROST) is
              significantly faster with linear runtimes, and most importantly,
              computes the distances between pairs of protein sequences to
              yield homologs at significantly lower levels of sequence identity
              than previously. The extent of allosteric effects in proteins
              points out the importance of global aspects of structure and
              sequence. PROST excels at global homology detection but not at
              detecting local homologs. Results are validated by strong
              similarities between the corresponding pairs of structures. The
              number of remote homologs detected increased significantly and
              pushes the effective sequence matches more deeply into the
              twilight zone. Human protein sequences presently having no
              assigned function now find significant numbers of putative
              homologs for 93\% of cases and structurally verified assigned
              functions for 76.4\% of these cases. The data compression enables
              massive searches for homologs with short search times while
              yielding significant gains in the numbers of remote homologs
              detected. The method is sufficiently efficient to permit
              whole-genome/proteome comparisons. The PROST web server is

                 are suspected metabolites of uncultured bacterial symbionts.
                 The antitumor polyketides of the pederin family, isolated from
                 beetles and sponges, are an example. Drug development from
                 such sources is commonly hampered by low yields and the
                 difficulty of sustaining invertebrate cultures. To obtain
                 insight into the true producer and find alternative supplies
                 of these rare drug candidates, the putative pederin
                 biosynthesis genes were cloned from total DNA of Paederus
                 fuscipes beetles, which use this compound for chemical
                 defense. Sequence analysis of the gene cluster and adjacent
                 regions revealed the presence of ORFs with typical bacterial
                 architecture and homologies. The ped cluster, which is present
                 only in beetle specimens with high pederin content, is located
                 on a 54-kb region bordered by transposase pseudogenes and
                 encodes a mixed modular polyketide synthase/nonribosomal
                 peptide synthetase. Notably, none of the modules contains
                 regions with homology to acyltransferase domains, but two
                 copies of isolated monodomain acyltransferase genes were found
                 at the upstream end of the cluster. In line with an
                 involvement in pederin biosynthesis, the upstream cluster
                 region perfectly mirrors pederin structure. The unexpected
                 presence of additional polyketide synthase/nonribosomal
                 peptide synthetase modules reveals surprising insights into
                 the evolutionary relationship between pederin-type pathways in

  abstract = "Given a group of genomes, represented as the sets of genes that
              belong to them, the discovery of the pangenomic content is based
              on the search of genetic homology among the genes for clustering
              them into families. Thus, pangenomic analyses investigate the
              membership of the families to the given genomes. This approach is
              referred to as the gene-oriented approach in contrast to other
              definitions of the problem that takes into account different
              genomic features. In the past years, several tools have been
              developed to discover and analyse pangenomic contents. Because of
              the hardness of the problem, each tool applies a different
              strategy for discovering the pangenomic content. This results in
              a differentiation of the performance of each tool that depends on
              the composition of the input genomes. This review reports the
              main analysis instruments provided by the current state of the

              neighbourhood-encoded proteins into homologous groups using
              sensitive sequence searching, and outputs a graphical

              factor of three compared to the next best method. Its

  abstract = "MOTIVATION: Ideally, only proteins that exhibit highly similar
              domain architectures should be compared with one another as
              homologues or be classified into a single family. By combining
              three different indices, the Jaccard index, the Goodman-Kruskal
              gamma function and the domain duplicate index, into a single
              similarity measure, we propose a method for comparing proteins
              based on their domain architectures. RESULTS: Evaluation of the
              method using the eukaryotic orthologous groups of proteins (KOGs)
              database indicated that it allows the automatic and efficient
              comparison of multiple-domain proteins, which are usually
              refractory to classic approaches based on sequence similarity
              measures. As a case study, the PDZ and LRR\_1 domains are used to
              demonstrate how proteins containing promiscuous domains can be
              clearly compared using our method. For the convenience of users,
              a web server was set up where three different query interfaces
              were implemented to compare different domain architectures or
              proteins with domain(s), and to identify the relationships among

              This is especially troublesome for marker genes like the

              satisfying high throughput performance demands. SINA was

              bioinformatics. It plays a key role in establishing structural,
              functional and evolutionary relationships between biological
              sequences. Although the power of the similarity search has
              increased steadily in recent years, a high percentage of
              sequences remain uncharacterized in the protein universe. Thus,
              new similarity search strategies are needed to efficiently and
              reliably infer the structure and function of new sequences. The
              existing paradigm for studying protein sequence, structure,
              function and evolution has been established based on the
              assumption that the protein universe is discrete and
              hierarchical. Cumulative evidence suggests that the protein
              universe is continuous. As a result, conventional sequence
              homology search methods may be not able to detect novel
              structural, functional and evolutionary relationships between
              proteins from weak and noisy sequence signals. To overcome the
              limitations in existing similarity search methods, we propose a

              similarity searches in bioinformatics. RESULTS: We apply ENTS to

              because of overlapping domain boundaries, finding a solution for
              the problem might become difficult. An accurate prediction of the
              domain architecture of a multi-domain protein provides important
              information for function prediction, comparative genomics and
              molecular evolution. RESULTS: We developed DAMA (Domain
              Annotation by a Multi-objective Approach), a novel approach that
              identifies architectures through a multi-objective optimization
              algorithm combining scores of domain matches, previously observed
              multi-domain co-occurrence and domain overlapping. DAMA has been
              validated on a known benchmark dataset based on CATH structural
              domain assignments and on the set of Plasmodium falciparum
              proteins. When compared with existing tools on both datasets, it
              outperforms all of them. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: DAMA

              genomes or the detection of (active) genes in microbial
              communities. Unfortunately, sequence assemblies of such datasets
              generally remain a computationally challenging task. Frequently,
              researchers are only interested in a specific group of organisms
              or genes; yet, the assembly of multiple datasets only to identify
              candidate sequences for a specific question is sometimes
              prohibitively slow, forcing researchers to select a subset of
              available datasets to address their question. Here, we present
              PhyloMagnet, a workflow to screen meta-omics datasets for taxa
              and genes of interest using gene-centric assembly and
              phylogenetic placement of sequences. RESULTS: Using PhyloMagnet,
              we could identify up to 87\% of the genera in an in vitro mock
              community with variable abundances, while the false positive
              predictions per single gene tree ranged from 0 to 23\%. When
              applied to a group of metagenomes for which a set of metagenome
              assembled genomes (MAGs) have been published, we could detect the
              majority of the taxonomic labels that the MAGs had been annotated
              with. In a metatranscriptomic setting, the phylogenetic placement
              of assembled contigs corresponds to that of transcripts obtained

              for conserved global regulatory proteins. In addition, as
              reviewed here, well-known autoregulators such as
              $\gamma$-butyrolactones, themselves products of secondary
              metabolism, accumulate late in growth to concentrations allowing
              their effective interaction with cognate binding proteins, in a
              necessary prelude to antibiotic biosynthesis. Most autoregulator

              Burkholderiales) and Candidatus Carsonella ruddii
              (Carsonella\_DC, Gammaproteobacteria: Oceanospirillales). Whereas
              Carsonella\_DC is a typical nutritional symbiont, Profftella\_DC
              is a unique defensive symbiont with organelle-like features,
              including intracellular localization within the host, perfect
              infection in host populations, vertical transmission over
              evolutionary time, and drastic genome reduction down to much less
              than 1 Mb. Large parts of the 460-kb genome of Profftella\_DC are
              devoted to genes for synthesizing a polyketide toxin; diaphorin.
              To better understand the evolution of this unusual symbiont, the
              present study analyzed the genome of Profftella\_Dco, a sister
              lineage to Profftella\_DC, using Diaphorina cf. continua, a host
              psyllid congeneric with D. citri. The genome of coresiding
              Carsonella (Carsonella\_Dco) was also analyzed. The analysis
              revealed nearly perfect synteny conservation in these genomes
              with their counterparts from D. citri. The substitution rate

              diaphorin, hemolysin, riboflavin, biotin, and carotenoids,
              underlining multiple roles of Profftella, which may contribute to
              stabilizing symbiotic relationships with the host. However, acyl

              synthases DipP and DipT for diaphorin synthesis in
              Profftella\_Dco. This level of acyl carrier protein augmentation,
              unprecedented in modular polyketide synthases of any known

              pangenome structure is a major goal of microbial evolution
              research. Recent work has highlighted that a substantial
              proportion of accessory genes appear to confer niche-specific
              adaptations. This work has primarily focused on selection acting
              at the level of individual cells. Herein, we discuss a lower
              level of selection that also contributes to pangenome variation:
              genic selection. This refers to cases where genetic elements,
              rather than individual cells, are the entities under selection.
              The clearest examples of this form of selection are selfish
              mobile genetic elements, which are those that have either a
              neutral or a deleterious effect on host fitness. We review the
              major classes of these and other mobile elements and discuss the
              characteristic features of such elements that could be under
              genic selection. We also discuss how genetic elements that are
              beneficial to hosts can also be under genic selection, a scenario
              that may be more prevalent but not widely appreciated, because
              disentangling the effects of selection at different levels (i.e.,
              organisms vs. genes) is challenging. Nonetheless, an appreciation

              erosion includes irreversible loss of genes in many functional
              categories and can include genes that underlie the nutritional
              contributions to hosts that are the basis of the symbiotic
              association. Candidatus Sulcia muelleri is an ancient symbiont of
              sap-feeding insects and is typically coresident with another
              bacterial symbiont that varies among host subclades. Previously
              sequenced Sulcia genomes retain pathways for the same eight

              the remaining two. Here, we describe a dual symbiotic system
              consisting of Sulcia and a novel species of Betaproteobacteria,
              Candidatus Zinderia insecticola, both living in the spittlebug

              that bacterial symbionts play in the host insect's biology and

              a comprehensive resource concerning the functions of genes and
              gene products (proteins and noncoding RNAs). GO annotations cover
              genes from organisms across the tree of life as well as viruses,
              though most gene function knowledge currently derives from
              experiments carried out in a relatively small number of model
              organisms. Here, we provide an updated overview of the GO
              knowledgebase, as well as the efforts of the broad, international
              consortium of scientists that develops, maintains, and updates
              the GO knowledgebase. The GO knowledgebase consists of three
              components: (1) the GO-a computational knowledge structure
              describing the functional characteristics of genes; (2) GO
              annotations-evidence-supported statements asserting that a
              specific gene product has a particular functional characteristic;
              and (3) GO Causal Activity Models (GO-CAMs)-mechanistic models of
              molecular ``pathways'' (GO biological processes) created by
              linking multiple GO annotations using defined relations. Each of
              these components is continually expanded, revised, and updated in
              response to newly published discoveries and receives extensive QA
              checks, reviews, and user feedback. For each of these components,
              we provide a description of the current contents, recent
              developments to keep the knowledgebase up to date with new
              discoveries, and guidance on how users can best make use of the
              data that we provide. We conclude with future directions for the

              antibiotics in intrinsically resistant Gram-negative bacteria",
  author   = "Cox, Georgina and Koteva, Kalinka and Wright, Gerard D",
  abstract = "OBJECTIVES: An orthogonal approach taken towards novel
              antibacterial drug discovery involves the identification of small
              molecules that potentiate or enhance the activity of existing
              antibacterial agents. This study aimed to identify
              natural-product rifampicin adjuvants in the intrinsically
              resistant organism Escherichia coli. METHODS: E. coli BW25113 was
              screened against 1120 actinomycete fermentation extracts in the
              presence of subinhibitory (2 mg/L) concentrations of rifampicin.
              The active molecule exhibiting the greatest rifampicin
              potentiation was isolated using activity-guided methods and
              identified using mass and NMR spectroscopy. Susceptibility
              testing and biochemical assays were used to determine the
              mechanism of antibiotic potentiation. RESULTS: The anthracycline
              Antibiotic 301A(1) was isolated from the fermentation broth of a
              strain of Streptomyces (WAC450); the molecule was shown to be
              highly synergistic with rifampicin (fractional inhibitory
              concentration index = 0.156) and moderately synergistic with
              linezolid (FIC index = 0.25) in both E. coli and Acinetobacter
              baumannii. Activity was associated with inhibition of efflux and
              the synergistic phenotype was lost when tested against E. coli
              harbouring mutations within the rpoB gene. Structure-activity
              relationship studies revealed that other anthracyclines do not
              synergize with rifampicin and removal of the sugar moiety of
              Antibiotic 301A(1) abolishes activity. CONCLUSIONS: Screening
              only a subsection of our natural product library identified a
              small-molecule antibiotic adjuvant capable of sensitizing
              Gram-negative bacteria to antibiotics to which they are
              ordinarily intrinsically resistant. This result demonstrates the
              great potential of this approach in expanding antibiotic
              effectiveness in the face of the growing challenge of resistance
              in Gram-negatives.",

              following an ancient transfer from a fungus",
  author   = "Nov{\'a}kov{\'a}, Eva and Moran, Nancy A",
  abstract = "The pea aphid genome was recently found to harbor genes for
              carotenoid biosynthesis, reflecting an ancestral transfer from a
              fungus. To explore the evolution of the carotene desaturase gene
              family within aphids, sequences were retrieved from a set of 34
              aphid species representing numerous deeply diverging lineages of
              aphids and analyzed together with fungal sequences retrieved from
              databases. All aphids have at least one copy of this gene and
              some aphid species have up to seven, whereas fungal genomes
              consistently have a single copy. The closest relatives of aphids,
              adelgids, also have carotene desaturase; these sequences are most
              closely related to those from aphids, supporting a shared origin
              from a fungal to insect transfer predating the divergence of
              adelgids and aphids. Likewise, all aphids, and adelgids, have
              carotenoid profiles that are consistent with their biosynthesis
              using the acquired genes of fungal origin rather than derivation
              from food plants. The carotene desaturase was acquired from a
              fungal species outside of Ascomycota or Basidiomycota and closest
              to Mucoromycotina among sequences available in databases. In
              aphids, an ongoing pattern of gene duplication is indicated by
              the presence of both anciently and recently diverged paralogs
              within genomes and by the presence of a high frequency of
              pseudogenes that appear to be recently inactivated. Recombination
              among paralogs is evident, making analyses of patterns of
              selection difficult, but tests of selection for a nonrecombining
              region indicates that duplications tend to be followed by bouts
              of positive selection. Species of Macrosiphini, which often show
              color polymorphisms, typically have a larger number of desaturase
              copies relative to other species sampled in the study. These
              results indicate that aphid evolution has been accompanied by
              ongoing evolution of carotenogenic genes, which have undergone
              duplication, recombination, and occasional positive selection to
              yield a wide variety of carotenoid profiles in different aphid
              species.",

  abstract = "Multi-drug resistant pathogens have become a major threat to
              human health and new antibiotics are urgently needed. Most
              antibiotics are derived from secondary metabolites produced by
              bacteria. In order to avoid suicide, these bacteria usually
              encode resistance genes, in some cases within the biosynthetic
              gene cluster (BGC) of the respective antibiotic compound. Modern
              genome mining tools enable researchers to computationally detect
              and predict BGCs that encode the biosynthesis of secondary
              metabolites. The major challenge now is the prioritization of the
              most promising BGCs encoding antibiotics with novel modes of
              action. A recently developed target-directed genome mining
              approach allows researchers to predict the mode of action of the
              encoded compound of an uncharacterized BGC based on the presence
              of resistant target genes. In 2017, we introduced the 'Antibiotic
              Resistant Target Seeker' (ARTS). ARTS allows for specific and
              efficient genome mining for antibiotics with interesting and
              novel targets by rapidly linking housekeeping and known
              resistance genes to BGC proximity, duplication and horizontal
              gene transfer (HGT) events. Here, we present ARTS 2.0 available

              extract detailed annotations from the literature to update or
              create reviewed entries, while unreviewed entries are
              supplemented with annotations provided by automated systems using
              a variety of machine-learning techniques. In addition, the
              scientific community continues their contributions of

              algorithm is approximately 4 times faster than CE and 20 times
              faster than DALI and SAL. On average, the resulting structure
              alignments have higher accuracy and coverage than those provided
              by these most often-used methods. TM-align is applied to an
              all-against-all structure comparison of 10 515 representative
              protein chains from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) with a sequence
              identity cutoff <95\%: 1996 distinct folds are found when a
              TM-score threshold of 0.5 is used. We also use TM-align to match
              the models predicted by TASSER for solved non-homologous proteins

              homologous proteins by comparing domain architectures, the
              organization of protein domains. A major obstacle in comparison
              of domain architecture is the existence of 'promiscuous' domains,
              which carry out auxiliary functions and appear in many unrelated
              proteins. To distinguish these promiscuous domains from protein
              domains, we assigned a weight score to each domain extracted from
              RefSeq proteins, based on its abundance and versatility. A
              domain's score represents its importance in the 'protein world'
              and is used in the comparison of domain architectures. In scoring
              domains, DAhunter also considers domain combinations as well as
              single domains. To measure the similarity of two domain
              architectures, we developed several methods that are based on
              algorithms used in information retrieval (the cosine similarity,

              Analysis Tools) aiming as a unified platform to analyze, compare
              and visualize protein data sets in various aspects of protein
              domain combinations. With InterProScan files for protein sets of
              interest provided by users, the server incorporates four services
              for domain analyses. First, it constructs protein phylogenetic
              tree based on a distance matrix calculated from protein domain
              architectures (DAs), allowing the comparison with a
              sequence-based tree. Second, it calculates and visualizes the
              versatility, abundance and co-presence of protein domains via a
              domain graph. Third, it compares the similarity of proteins based
              on DA alignment. Fourth, it builds a putative protein network
              derived from domain-domain interactions from DOMINE. Users may
              select a variety of input data files and flexibly choose domain
              search tools (e.g. hmmpfam, superfamily) for a specific analysis.
              Results from the d-Omix could be interactively explored and
              exported into various formats such as SVG, JPG, BMP and CSV.
              Users with only protein sequences could prepare an InterProScan

              Three sequence scanning algorithms--MAST, FIMO and
              GLAM2SCAN--allow scanning numerous DNA and protein sequence
              databases for motifs discovered by MEME and GLAM2. Transcription

              compared with motifs in many popular motif databases using the
              motif database scanning algorithm TOMTOM. Transcription factor
              motifs can be further analyzed for putative function by
              association with Gene Ontology (GO) terms using the motif-GO term
              association tool GOMO. MEME output now contains sequence LOGOS

              methods with methods of predicting protein-coding and RNA genes
              and other functional elements directly from sequence. A new gene
              finding tool, GeneMarkS+, uses the combined evidence of protein
              and RNA placement by homology as an initial map of annotation to
              generate and modify ab initio gene predictions across the whole
              genome. Thus, the new NCBI's Prokaryotic Genome Annotation
              Pipeline (PGAP) relies more on sequence similarity when confident
              comparative data are available, while it relies more on
              statistical predictions in the absence of external evidence. The
              pipeline provides a framework for generation and analysis of
              annotation on the full breadth of prokaryotic taxonomy. For
              additional information on PGAP see

              earth, and while most of this diversity remains completely
              unexplored, advances in genome sequencing have provided
              unprecedented glimpses into the virosphere. The Prokaryotic Virus
              Orthologous Groups (pVOGs, formerly called Phage Orthologous
              Groups, POGs) resource has aided in this task over the past
              decade by using automated methods to keep pace with the rapid
              increase in genomic data. The uses of pVOGs include functional
              annotation of viral proteins, identification of genes and viruses
              in uncharacterized DNA samples, phylogenetic analysis,
              large-scale comparative genomics projects, and more. The pVOGs
              database represents a comprehensive set of orthologous gene
              families shared across multiple complete genomes of viruses that
              infect bacterial or archaeal hosts (viruses of eukaryotes will be
              added at a future date). The pVOGs are constructed within the
              Clusters of Orthologous Groups (COGs) framework that is widely
              used for orthology identification in prokaryotes. Since the
              previous release of the POGs, the size has tripled to nearly 3000
              genomes and 300 000 proteins, and the number of conserved
              orthologous groups doubled to 9518. User-friendly webpages are
              available, including multiple sequence alignments and HMM
              profiles for each VOG. These changes provide major improvements
              to the pVOGs database, at a time of rapid advances in virus

              by consistently annotating the microbial contents of collected
              samples using state-of-art toolsets and by manual curation of the
              meta-data of the corresponding human hosts. GMrepo organizes the
              collected samples according to their associated phenotypes and
              includes all possible related meta-data such as age, sex,
              country, body-mass-index (BMI) and recent antibiotics usage. To
              make relevant information easier to access, GMrepo is equipped
              with a graphical query builder, enabling users to make
              customized, complex and biologically relevant queries. For

  abstract = "Bacterial symbionts are widespread in insects and other animals.
              Most of them are predominantly vertically transmitted, along with
              their hosts' genes, and thus extend the heritable genetic
              variation present in one species. These passengers have a variety
              of repercussions on the host's phenotypes: besides the cost
              imposed on the host for maintaining the symbiont population, they
              can provide fitness advantages to the host or manipulate the
              host's reproduction. We argue that insect symbioses are ideal
              model systems for community genetics. First, bacterial symbionts
              directly or indirectly affect the interactions with other species
              within a community. Examples include their involvement in
              modifying the use of host plants by phytophagous insects, in
              providing resistance to natural enemies, but also in reducing the
              global genetic diversity or gene flow between populations within
              some species. Second, one emerging picture in insect symbioses is
              that many species are simultaneously infected with more than one
              symbiont, which permits studying the factors that shape bacterial
              communities; for example, horizontal transmission, interactions
              between host genotype, symbiont genotype and the environment and
              interactions among symbionts. One conclusion is that insects'
              symbiotic complements are dynamic communities that affect and are
              affected by the communities in which they are embedded.",

               important for medicine and agriculture alike, and for the

               aims at extracting biosynthetic information from the genomes of
               microbes presumed to produce these compounds. Typically,
               canonical enzyme sequences from known biosynthetic systems are
               identified after sequence similarity searches. Despite this
               being an efficient process, the likelihood of identifying truly
               novel systems by this approach is low. To overcome this
               limitation, we previously introduced EvoMining, a genome-mining
               approach that incorporates evolutionary principles. Here, we
               release and use our latest EvoMining version, which includes
               novel visualization features and customizable databases, to
               analyse 42 central metabolic enzyme families (EFs) conserved
               throughout Actinobacteria, Cyanobacteria, Pseudomonas and
               Archaea. We found that expansion-and-recruitment profiles of
               these 42 families are lineage specific, opening the metabolic
               space related to 'shell' enzymes. These enzymes, which have been
               overlooked, are EFs with orthologues present in most of the
               genomes of a taxonomic group, but not in all. As a case study of
               canonical shell enzymes, we characterized the expansion and
               recruitment of glutamate dehydrogenase and acetolactate synthase
               into scytonemin biosynthesis, and into other central metabolic
               pathways driving Archaea and Bacteria adaptive evolution. By
               defining the origin and fate of enzymes, EvoMining complements
               traditional genome-mining approaches as an unbiased strategy and
               opens the door to gaining insights into the evolution of NP
               biosynthesis. We anticipate that EvoMining will be broadly used

               panel of Streptomyces strains and species (125) whose
               chromosomes are completely sequenced and assembled was selected.
               The pan-genome of the genus was modelled and shown to be open
               with a core-genome reaching 1018 genes. The evolution of
               Streptomyces chromosome was analysed by carrying out pairwise
               comparisons, and by monitoring indexes measuring the
               conservation of genes (presence/absence) and their synteny along
               the chromosome. Using the phylogenetic depth offered by the
               chosen panel, it was possible to infer that within the central
               region of the chromosome, the core-genes form a highly conserved

              diversification among Salinispora species. By coupling the
              genomic analyses with high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry
              (LC-MS/MS), we identified that BGC evolution in Salinispora
              proceeds largely through gene gain/loss events and constrained
              recombination that contributes to interspecies diversity at the
              gene, pathway, and metabolite levels. Consequently, the
              evolutionary processes driving BGC diversification had direct
              consequences for compound production and contributed to chemical
              diversification, as exemplified in our case study of the
              medically relevant proteosome inhibitors, the salinosporamides.
              Together, our results support the concept that specialized
              metabolites, and their cognate BGCs, represent functional traits
              associated with niche differentiation among Salinispora species.
              ![Figure][1] GRAPHICAL ABSTRACT \#\#\#\# SIGNIFICANCE
              SIGNIFICANCE Natural products are traditionally exploited for
              their pharmaceutical potential; yet what is often overlooked is
              that the evolution of the biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs)
              encoding these small molecules likely affects the diversification
              of the produced compounds and implicitly has an impact on the
              compounds' activities and ecological functions. And while the
              prevailing dogma in natural product research attributes frequent
              and widespread horizontal gene transfer (HGT) as an integral
              driver of BGC evolution, we find that the majority of BGC
              diversity derives from processes of vertical descent, with HGT
              events being rare. This understanding can facilitate informed
              biosynthetic predictions to identify novel natural products, in
              addition to uncovering how these specialized metabolites
              contribute to the environmental distribution of microbes. \#\#\#

  abstract = "Polyketides are a complex family of natural products that often
              serve competitive or pro-survival purposes but can also
              demonstrate bioactivity in human diseases as, for example
              cholesterol lowering agents, anti-infectives, or anti-tumor
              agents. Marine invertebrates and microbes are a rich source of
              polyketides. Palmerolide A, a polyketide isolated from the
              Antarctic ascidian Synoicum adareanum , is a vacuolar-ATPase
              inhibitor with potent bioactivity against melanoma cell lines.
              The biosynthetic gene clusters (BGC) responsible for production
              of secondary metabolites are encoded in the genomes of the
              producers as discrete genomic elements. A putative palmerolide
              BGC was identified from a S. adareanum metagenome based on a high
              degree of congruence with a chemical structure-based
              retrobiosynthetic prediction. Protein family homology analysis,
              conserved domain searches, and active site and motif
              identification were used to confirm the identity and propose the
              function of the 75 kb trans -acyltransferase (AT) polyketide
              synthase-non-ribosomal synthase (PKS-NRPS) domains responsible
              for the synthesis of palmerolide A. Though PKS systems often act
              in a predictable co-linear sequence, this BGC includes multiple
              trans -acting enzymatic domains, a non-canonical condensation
              termination domain, a bacterial luciferase-like monooxygenase
              (LLM), and multiple copies found within the metagenome-assembled
              genome (MAG) of Candidatus Synoicohabitans palmerolidicus.
              Detailed inspection of the five highly similar pal BGC copies
              suggests the potential for biosynthesis of other members of the
              palmerolide chemical family. This is the first delineation of a
              biosynthetic gene cluster from an Antarctic species. These
              findings have relevance for fundamental knowledge of PKS
              combinatorial biosynthesis and could enhance drug development
              efforts of palmerolide A through heterologous gene expression.
              Significance Statement Complex interactions exist between
              microbiomes and their hosts. Increasingly, defensive metabolites
              that have been attributed to host biosynthetic capability are now
              being recognized as products of associated microbes. These unique
              metabolites often have bioactivity in targets of human disease
              and can be purposed as pharmaceuticals. The molecular machinery
              for production of palmerolide A, a macrolide that is potent and
              selective against melanoma, was discovered as a genomic cluster
              in the microbiome of an Antarctic ascidian. Multiple
              non-identical copies of this genomic information provide clues to
              differences in specific enzymatic domains and point to Nature's
              ability to perform combinatorial biosynthesis in situ .
              Harnessing this genetic information may pave a path for
              development of a palmerolide-based drug. \#\#\# Competing

              since the isolation of the continent and formation of the
              Antarctic circumpolar current. Scientific inquiry into the
              novelty of marine natural products produced by Antarctic benthic
              invertebrates led to the discovery of a bioactive macrolide,
              palmerolide A, that has specific activity against melanoma and
              holds considerable promise as an anticancer therapeutic. While
              this compound was isolated from the Antarctic ascidian Synoicum
              adareanum , its biosynthesis has since been hypothesized to be
              microbially mediated, given structural similarities to
              microbially-produced hybrid non-ribosomal peptide-polyketide

              polyketide synthase-non-ribosomal peptide synthetase and

              palmerolide-gene targets and a single 16S rRNA gene variant
              (R=0.83 -- 0.99). Through repeated rounds of metagenome
              sequencing followed by binning contigs into metagenome-assembled
              genomes, we were able to retrieve a near-complete genome (10
              contigs) of the BGC organism, a novel verrucomicrobium within the
              Opitutaceae family that we propose here as Candidatus
              Synoicihabitans palmerolidicus. The refined genome assembly

              functional features that shed light on the host-associated nature
              of this unique bacterium. Significance Statement Palmerolide A
              has potential as a chemotherapeutic agent to target melanoma. We
              interrogated the microbiome of the Antarctic ascidian, Synoicum
              adarenum , using a cultivation-independent high-throughput
              sequencing and bioinformatic strategy. The metagenome-encoded
              biosynthetic machinery predicted to produce palmerolide A was
              found to be associated with the genome of a member of the S.
              adareanum core microbiome. Phylogenomic analysis suggests the

              Synoicihabitans palmerolidicus, in the Opitutaceae family of the

              The metabolic and functional potentials of these uncultivated
              microorganisms thus remain mysterious, and the
              metagenome-assembled genome (MAG) approach is the most robust
              method for uncovering these potentials. However, MAGs discovered
              by conventional metagenomic assembly and binning methods are
              usually highly fragmented genomes with heterogeneous sequence
              contamination, and this affects the accuracy and sensitivity of
              genomic analyses. Though the maturation of long-read sequencing
              technologies provides a good opportunity to fix the problem of
              highly fragmented MAGs as mentioned above, the method's
              error-prone nature causes severe problems of long-read-alone
              metagenomics. Hence, methods are urgently needed to retrieve MAGs
              by a combination of both long- and short-read technologies to
              advance genome-centric metagenomics. Results In this study, we
              combined Illumina and Nanopore data to develop a new workflow to
              reconstruct 233 MAGs---six novel bacterial orders, 20 families,
              66 genera, and 154 species---from Lake Shunet, a secluded
              meromictic lake in Siberia. Those new MAGs were underrepresented
              or undetectable in other MAGs studies using metagenomes from
              human or other common organisms or habitats. Using this newly
              developed workflow and strategy, the average N50 of reconstructed
              MAGs greatly increased 10--40-fold compared to when the
              conventional Illumina assembly and binning method were used. More
              importantly, six complete MAGs were recovered from our datasets,
              five of which belong to novel species. We used these as examples
              to demonstrate many novel and intriguing genomic characteristics
              discovered in these newly complete genomes and proved the
              importance of high-quality complete MAGs in microbial genomics
              and metagenomics studies. Conclusions The results show that it is
              feasible to apply our workflow with a few additional long reads
              to recover numerous complete and high-quality MAGs from
              short-read metagenomes of high microbial diversity environment
              samples. The unique features we identified from five complete
              genomes highlight the robustness of this method in genome-centric
              metagenomic research. The recovery of 154 novel species MAGs from

              genomic characteristics of bacteria. It demonstrates a strong

              Acidobacteria were particularly abundant in the vernal pool

              heterogeneity of individual cells in unprecedented detail. A
              common step in the analysis of scRNA-seq data is the selection of
              so-called marker genes, most commonly to enable annotation of the
              biological cell types present in the sample. In this paper we
              benchmarked 56 computational methods for selecting marker genes
              in scRNA-seq data. The performance of the methods was compared
              using 10 real scRNA-seq datasets and over 170 additional
              simulated datasets. Methods were compared on their ability to
              recover simulated and expert-annotated marker genes, the
              predictive performance and characteristics of the gene sets they
              select, their memory usage and speed and their implementation

              indicating that numerical dominance does not imply
              transcriptional dominance. We found that although some primary
              metabolic functions appeared upregulated, they were not obviously

              transcriptional activity of individual bacteria in the context of
              four different sponge holobionts. Using this approach we found

              to improve MOA predictions by integrating data from the
              cytological profiling high-content imaging platform and the gene
              expression platform FUSION, and pairs these data with untargeted
              metabolomics analysis for de novo bioactive compound discovery.
              The predictive value of the integrative approach was assessed
              using a library of target-annotated small molecules as
              benchmarks. Using Kolmogorov--Smirnov (KS) tests to compare
              in-class to out-of-class similarity, we found that SNF retains
              the ability to identify significant in-class similarity across a
              diverse set of target classes, and could also find target classes
              that were not detectable in either platform alone. This confirmed
              that integration of expression-based and image-based phenotypes
              can accurately report on MOA. Furthermore, we integrated
              untargeted metabolomics of complex natural product fractions with
              the SNF network to map biological signatures to specific
              metabolites. Three examples are presented where SNF coupled with
              metabolomics was used to directly functionally characterize
              natural products and accelerate identification of bioactive
              metabolites, including the discovery of the novel
              azoxy-containing biaryl compounds parkamycins A and B. Our
              results support SNF integration of multiple phenotypic screening
              approaches along with untargeted metabolomics as a powerful
              approach for advancing natural products drug discovery.
              Significance statement New data-driven methods to aid in the
              discovery and biological characterization of natural products are
              necessary to advance the field. Assigning the mechanism of action
              (MOA) to novel bioactive compounds is an essential step in drug
              discovery and a major challenge in chemical biology. Despite
              technological advances in isolation, synthesis and screening
              strategies that make many bioactive substances readily available,
              in most cases their biological targets remain unknown.
              Additionally, a major bottleneck in natural products discovery
              efforts is de-replication of the large number of known compounds
              that predominate in crude extracts and fraction libraries.
              Advances in metabolomics has provided a better understanding of
              the constituents present in these libraries, but is not
              sufficient in itself to drive the discovery of novel biologically
              active metabolites. Here we describe an unbiased, data-driven

                 We describe a novel method for predicting
                 transcription-factor-binding sites in Escherichia coli. Our
                 method takes advantage of the principle that transcription
                 factors frequently coregulate gene expression, but without
                 requiring prior knowledge of which groups of genes are
                 coregulated. Using position weight matrices for 49 known
                 transcription factors, we examined spacings between pairs of
                 matrix hits. These pairs were assigned probabilities according
                 to the overrepresentation of their separation distance. The
                 functions of many open reading frames (ORFs) downstream from
                 predicted binding sites are unknown, and may correspond to
                 novel regulon members. For five predictions, knockouts with
                 mutated replacements of the predicted binding sites were
                 created in E. coli MG1655. Quantitative real-time PCR (RT-PCR)
                 indicates that for each of the knockouts, at least one gene
                 immediately downstream exhibits a statistically significant
                 change in mRNA expression. This approach may be useful in

              in multi-domain proteins",
  author   = "Hegyi, H and Gerstein, M",
  abstract = "Annotation transfer is a principal process in genome annotation.
              It involves ``transferring'' structural and functional annotation
              to uncharacterized open reading frames (ORFs) in a newly
              completed genome from experimentally characterized proteins
              similar in sequence. To prevent errors in genome annotation, it
              is important that this process be robust and statistically
              well-characterized, especially with regard to how it depends on
              the degree of sequence similarity. Previously, we and others have
              analyzed annotation transfer in single-domain proteins.
              Multi-domain proteins, which make up the bulk of the ORFs in
              eukaryotic genomes, present more complex issues in functional
              conservation. Here we present a large-scale survey of annotation
              transfer in these proteins, using scop superfamilies to define
              domain folds and a thesaurus based on SWISS-PROT keywords to
              define functional categories. Our survey reveals that
              multi-domain proteins have significantly less functional
              conservation than single-domain ones, except when they share the
              exact same combination of domain folds. In particular, we find
              that for multi-domain proteins, approximate function can be
              accurately transferred with only 35\% certainty for pairs of
              proteins sharing one structural superfamily. In contrast, this
              value is 67\% for pairs of single-domain proteins sharing the
              same structural superfamily. On the other hand, if two
              multi-domain proteins contain the same combination of two
              structural superfamilies the probability of their sharing the
              same function increases to 80\% in the case of complete coverage
              along the full length of both proteins, this value increases
              further to > 90\%. Moreover, we found that only 70 of the current
              total of 455 structural superfamilies are found in both single
              and multi-domain proteins and only 14 of these were associated
              with the same function in both categories of proteins. We also
              investigated the degree to which function could be transferred
              between pairs of multi-domain proteins with respect to the degree
              of sequence similarity between them, finding that functional
              divergence at a given amount of sequence similarity is always
              about two-fold greater for pairs of multi-domain proteins
              (sharing similarity over a single domain) in comparison to pairs
              of single-domain ones, though the overall shape of the
              relationship is quite similar. Further information is available

               scientific communities with high computing demands, like high
               energy physics. Computing resources are being distributed over
               many independent sites with only a thin layer of grid middleware

               convenient for computing resource providers, but has introduced
               several problems for the users of the system, the three major
               being the complexity of job scheduling, the non-uniformity of
               compute resources, and the lack of good job monitoring. Pilot

              demonstrate that the transcription of its ectABCD genes is
              osmotically induced and functional since it leads to the

              Although extensively studied as a model bacterium, 34\% of the

              hypothesized that some of them may correspond to functional

              nevertheless functional when expressed, and promote adhesion to
              abiotic and/or epithelial cell surfaces. While the studied

              facultative symbioses, in which one partner is not essential to
              the other. Facultative symbioses are expected to be transitional
              stages along an evolutionary trajectory toward obligate

              Ca. Glomeribacter gigasporarum, nonessential endosymbionts of
              arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (Glomeromycota). We found that

              matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass
              spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) devices has revolutionized the
              routine identification of microorganisms in clinical microbiology
              laboratories by introducing an easy, rapid, high throughput,
              low-cost, and efficient identification technique. This technology
              has been adapted to the constraint of clinical diagnostic
              laboratories and has the potential to replace and/or complement
              conventional identification techniques for both bacterial and
              fungal strains. Using standardized procedures, the resolution of
              MALDI-TOF MS allows accurate identification at the species level

              identify AMR genes in whole-genome sequences, the National Center
              for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) has produced AMRFinder, a
              tool that identifies AMR genes using a high-quality curated AMR
              gene reference database. The Bacterial Antimicrobial Resistance
              Reference Gene Database consists of up-to-date gene nomenclature,
              a set of hidden Markov models (HMMs), and a curated protein
              family hierarchy. Currently, it contains 4,579 antimicrobial
              resistance proteins and more than 560 HMMs. Here, we describe
              AMRFinder and its associated database. To assess the predictive

              protein-large ATP-binding regulator of the LuxR family (SARP-LAL)
              regulator binds the promoter of a PAS-LuxR regulator-encoding
              gene and activates its transcription, and in turn, the gene
              product of the latter activates transcription from various
              promoters of the polyene gene cluster directly. The primary
              operator of PimR, the archetype of SARP-LAL regulators, contains
              three heptameric direct repeats separated by four-nucleotide
              spacers, but the regulator can also bind a secondary operator
              with only two direct repeats separated by a 3-nucleotide spacer,
              both located in the promoter region of its unique target gene,
              pimM A similar arrangement of operators has been identified for
              PimR counterparts encoded by gene clusters for different
              antifungal secondary metabolites, including not only polyene
              macrolides but peptidyl nucleosides, phoslactomycins, or
              cycloheximide. Here, we used promoter engineering and

              contributions of the different heptameric repeats to
              transcriptional activation and final polyene production.
              Optimized promoters have thus been developed. Deletion studies
              and electrophoretic mobility assays were used for the definition
              of DNA-binding boxes formed by 22-nucleotide sequences comprising
              two conserved heptameric direct repeats separated by
              four-nucleotide less conserved spacers. The cooperative binding
              of PimRSARP appears to be the mechanism involved in the binding
              of regulator monomers to operators, and at least two protein
              monomers are required for efficient binding.IMPORTANCE Here, we
              have shown that a modulation of the production of the antifungal
              pimaricin in Streptomyces natalensis can be accomplished via
              promoter engineering of the PAS-LuxR transcriptional activator
              pimM The expression of this gene is controlled by the
              Streptomyces antibiotic regulatory protein-large ATP-binding
              regulator of the LuxR family (SARP-LAL) regulator PimR, which
              binds a series of heptameric direct repeats in its promoter
              region. The structure and importance of such repeats in protein
              binding, transcriptional activation, and polyene production have
              been investigated. These findings should provide important clues
              to understand the regulatory machinery that modulates antibiotic
              biosynthesis in Streptomyces and open new possibilities for the
              manipulation of metabolite production. The presence of PimR
              orthologues encoded by gene clusters for different secondary
              metabolites and the conservation of their operators suggest that
              the improvements observed in the activation of pimaricin

              biosynthesis and assembly of various fimbriae. In this study,
              each of the 12 operons was deleted in E. coli MG1655, and the
              resulting 12 deletion mutants all grew better than the wild type,
              especially in the nutrient-deficient M9 medium. When the plasmid
              pBHR68 containing the key genes for polyhydroxyalkanoate
              production was introduced into these 12 mutants, each mutant
              synthesized more polyhydroxyalkanoate than the wild-type control.
              These results indicate that the fimbria removal in E. coli
              benefits cell growth and polyhydroxyalkanoate production.
              Therefore, all 12 chaperone-usher operons, including 64 genes,
              were deleted in MG1655, resulting in the fimbria-lacking strain

              were observed on the surface of WQM026 cells. Transcriptomic
              analysis showed that in WQM026 cells, the genes related to
              glucose consumption, glycolysis, flagellar synthesis, and
              biosynthetic pathways of some key amino acids were upregulated,
              while the tricarboxylic acid cycle-related genes were

              intracellular metabolic networks in E. coli. We found that
              eliminating fimbriae could effectively improve the production of
              polyhydroxyalkanoate and l-threonine in E. coli MG1655. These
              results contribute to understanding the necessity of fimbriae and
              the advantages of fimbria removal for industrial microorganisms.

              kb containing 15 ORFS, 11 of them forming part of the cluster, in
              the heterologous host Streptomyces albus, allowing the isolation
              of a biosynthetic intermediate. In addition, the expression in S.
              albus of the entire cluster, contained in a region of 34.8 kb,
              combined with the expression of plasmid pRHAM, directing the
              biosynthesis of L-rhamnose, led to the production of steffimycin.
              Inactivation of the stfX gene, coding for a putative cyclase,
              revealed that this enzymatic activity participates in the
              cyclization of the fourth ring, making the final steps in the
              biosynthesis of the steffimycin aglycon similar to those in the
              biosynthesis of jadomycin or rabelomycin. Inactivation of the
              stfG gene, coding for a putative glycosyltransferase involved in
              the attachment of L-rhamnose, allowed the production of a new
              compound corresponding to the steffimycin aglycon compound also
              observed in S. albus upon expression of the entire cluster.",

              and locations are essential for microbiology, but the large
              majority of taxa either remain uncultivated or lack isolates from
              diverse geographic locales. We paired large-scale
              dilution-to-extinction (DTE) cultivation with microbial community
              analysis and modeling to expand the phylogenetic and geographic
              diversity of cultivated bacterioplankton and to evaluate DTE
              cultivation success. Here, we report results from 17 DTE
              experiments totaling 7,820 individual incubations over 3 years,
              yielding 328 repeatably transferable isolates. Comparison of
              isolates to microbial community data for source waters indicated
              that we successfully isolated 5\% of the observed
              bacterioplankton community throughout the study; 43\% and 26\% of
              our isolates matched operational taxonomic units and amplicon
              single-nucleotide variants, respectively, within the top 50 most
              abundant taxa. Isolates included those from previously
              uncultivated clades such as SAR11 LD12 and Actinobacteria acIV,
              as well as geographically novel members from other ecologically
              important groups like SAR11 subclade IIIa, SAR116, and others,
              providing isolates in eight putatively new genera and seven
              putatively new species. Using a newly developed DTE cultivation
              model, we evaluated taxon viability by comparing relative
              abundance with cultivation success. The model (i) revealed the
              minimum attempts required for successful isolation of taxa
              amenable to growth on our media and (ii) identified possible
              subpopulation viability variation in abundant taxa such as SAR11
              that likely impacts cultivation success. By incorporating
              viability in experimental design, we can now statistically
              constrain the effort necessary for successful cultivation of
              specific taxa on a defined medium.IMPORTANCE Even before the
              coining of the term ``great plate count anomaly'' in the 1980s,
              scientists had noted the discrepancy between the number of
              microorganisms observed under the microscope and the number of
              colonies that grew on traditional agar media. New cultivation
              approaches have reduced this disparity, resulting in the
              isolation of some of the ``most wanted'' bacterial lineages.
              Nevertheless, the vast majority of microorganisms remain
              uncultured, hampering progress toward answering fundamental
              biological questions about many important microorganisms.
              Furthermore, few studies have evaluated the underlying factors
              influencing cultivation success, limiting our ability to improve
              cultivation efficacy. Our work details the use of
              dilution-to-extinction (DTE) cultivation to expand the
              phylogenetic and geographic diversity of available axenic
              cultures. We also provide a new model of the DTE approach that
              uses cultivation results and natural abundance information to
              predict taxon-specific viability and iteratively constrain DTE
              experimental design to improve cultivation success.",

              the marine sponge Haliclona (gellius) sp.: agar plate cultures,
              liquid cultures, and floating filter cultures. A variety of
              oligotrophic media were employed, including media with aqueous
              and organic sponge extracts, bacterial signal molecules, and
              siderophores. More than 3,900 isolates were analyzed, and 205
              operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were identified. Media
              containing low concentrations of mucin or a mixture of peptone
              and starch were most successful for the isolation of diversity,
              while the commonly used marine broth did not result in a high
              diversity among isolates. The addition of antibiotics generally
              led to a reduced diversity on plates but yielded different
              bacteria than other media. In addition, diversity patterns of
              isolates from agar plates, liquid cultures, and floating filters
              were significantly different. Almost 89\% of all isolates were
              Alphaproteobacteria; however, members of phyla that are less
              commonly encountered in cultivation studies, such as
              Planctomycetes, Verrucomicrobia, and Deltaproteobacteria, were
              isolated as well. The sponge-associated bacteria were categorized
              into three different groups. The first group represented OTUs
              that were also obtained in a clone library from previously
              analyzed sponge tissue (group 1). Furthermore, we distinguished
              OTUs that were obtained from sponge tissue (in a previous study)
              but not from sponge isolates (group 2), and there were also OTUs
              that were not obtained from sponge tissue but were obtained from
              sponge isolates (group 3). The 17 OTUs categorized into group 1
              represented 10 to 14\% of all bacterial OTUs that were present in
              a large clone library previously generated from Haliclona
              (gellius) sp. sponge tissue, which is higher than previously
              reported cultivability scores for sponge-associated bacteria. Six
              of these 17 OTUs were not obtained from agar plates, which
              underlines that the use of multiple cultivation methods is

              identified a chromosomal region (designated lpfABCC'DE) in EHEC
              O157:H7 containing six putative open reading frames that was
              found to be closely related to the long polar (LP) fimbria operon

              order and in conservation of the deduced amino acid sequences. We
              show that lpfABCC'DE is organized as an operon and that its
              expression is induced during the exponential growth phase. The
              lpf genes from EHEC strain EDL933 were introduced into a

              characterized the IS256 transposase as a DNA-binding protein and
              obtained insight into the subdomain organization and functional
              properties of this prototype enzyme of IS256 family transposases.
              Recombinant forms of the transposase were shown to bind
              specifically to inverted repeats present in the IS256 noncoding
              regions. A DNA-binding domain was identified in the N-terminal
              part of the transposase, and a mutagenesis study targeting

              2-ketoglutaric acid, L-alanine, ethanolamine, and citric acid. We
              have previously reported the cloning and characterization of the
              pvuA gene, which encodes the 78-kDa outer membrane receptor
              protein for ferric vibrioferrin. In this study, nine genes
              involved in the biosynthesis and transport of vibrioferrin have
              been identified in the genomic regions surrounding the pvuA gene.
              The genes were sequenced, and gene disruptants were constructed
              by insertion mutation for phenotype analysis. Five of the genes,
              named pvsABCDE, constitute an operon that is expressed under
              iron-limiting conditions. Homology searches of their predicted
              protein products suggested that the four genes pvsABDE are
              implicated in the biosynthesis of the siderophore. Another gene
              in the same operon, pvsC, encodes a putative exporter that is
              homologous to members of the major facilitator superfamily of
              multidrug efflux pumps. The remaining four genes, named pvuBCDE,

              Typically, each species produces several antibiotics, with the
              profile being species specific. Streptomyces coelicolor, the
              model species, produces at least five different antibiotics. We
              review the regulation of antibiotic biosynthesis in S. coelicolor
              and other, nonmodel streptomycetes in the light of recent
              studies. The biosynthesis of each antibiotic is specified by a
              large gene cluster, usually including regulatory genes
              (cluster-situated regulators [CSRs]). These are the main point of
              connection with a plethora of generally conserved regulatory
              systems that monitor the organism's physiology, developmental
              state, population density, and environment to determine the onset
              and level of production of each antibiotic. Some CSRs may also be
              sensitive to the levels of different kinds of ligands, including
              products of the pathway itself, products of other antibiotic
              pathways in the same organism, and specialized regulatory small

  abstract = "While specialized metabolites are thought to mediate ecological
              interactions, the evolutionary processes driving chemical
              diversification, particularly among closely related lineages,
              remain poorly understood. Here, we examine the evolutionary
              dynamics governing the distribution of natural product
              biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) among 118 strains representing
              all nine currently named species of the marine actinobacterial
              genus Salinispora. While much attention has been given to the
              role of horizontal gene transfer (HGT) in structuring BGC
              distributions, we find that vertical descent facilitates
              interspecies BGC diversification over evolutionary timescales.
              Moreover, we identified a distinct phylogenetic signal among
              Salinispora species at both the BGC and metabolite level,
              indicating that specialized metabolism represents a conserved
              phylogenetic trait. Using a combination of genomic analyses and
              liquid chromatography-high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry
              (LC-MS/MS) targeting nine experimentally characterized BGCs and
              their small molecule products, we identified gene gain/loss
              events, constrained interspecies recombination, and other
              evolutionary processes associated with vertical inheritance as
              major contributors to BGC diversification. These evolutionary
              dynamics had direct consequences for the compounds produced, as
              exemplified by species-level differences in salinosporamide
              production. Together, our results support the concept that
              specialized metabolites, and their cognate BGCs, can represent
              phylogenetically conserved functional traits with chemical
              diversification proceeding in species-specific patterns over
              evolutionary time frames. IMPORTANCE Microbial natural products
              are traditionally exploited for their pharmaceutical potential,
              yet our understanding of the evolutionary processes driving BGC
              evolution and compound diversification remain poorly developed.
              While HGT is recognized as an integral driver of BGC
              distributions, we find that the effects of vertical inheritance
              on BGC diversification had direct implications for species-level
              specialized metabolite production. As such, understanding the
              degree of genetic variation that corresponds to species
              delineations can enhance natural product discovery efforts.
              Resolving the evolutionary relationships between closely related
              strains and specialized metabolism can also facilitate our

  abstract = "Metagenomic profiling is challenging in part because of the
              highly uneven sampling of the tree of life by genome sequencing
              projects and the limitations imposed by performing phylogenetic
              inference at fixed taxonomic ranks. We present the algorithm
              MetaPalette, which uses long k-mer sizes (k = 30, 50) to fit a
              k-mer ``palette'' of a given sample to the k-mer palette of
              reference organisms. By modeling the k-mer palettes of unknown
              organisms, the method also gives an indication of the presence,
              abundance, and evolutionary relatedness of novel organisms
              present in the sample. The method returns a traditional,
              fixed-rank taxonomic profile which is shown on independently
              simulated data to be one of the most accurate to date. Tree
              figures are also returned that quantify the relatedness of novel
              organisms to reference sequences, and the accuracy of such
              figures is demonstrated on simulated spike-ins and a metagenomic
              soil sample. The software implementing MetaPalette is available

              step when analyzing a metagenomic sample. This work presents a
              method that facilitates fine-scale characterization of the

              taxon-specific markers. The compositions of palettes are easy to

              often yields a large number of conspecific isolates. Increasing
              the diversity covered by an isolate collection entails the
              implementation of methods and protocols to minimize the number of
              redundant isolates. Matrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization
              time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry methods are ideally
              suited to this dereplication problem because of their low cost
              and high throughput. However, the available software tools are
              cumbersome and rely either on the prior development of reference
              databases or on global similarity analyses, which are
              inconvenient and offer low taxonomic resolution. We introduce
              SPeDE, a user-friendly spectral data analysis tool for the
              dereplication of MALDI-TOF mass spectra. Rather than relying on
              global similarity approaches to classify spectra, SPeDE
              determines the number of unique spectral features by a mix of
              global and local peak comparisons. This approach allows the
              identification of a set of nonredundant spectra linked to
              operational isolation units. We evaluated SPeDE on a data set of
              5,228 spectra representing 167 bacterial strains belonging to 132
              genera across six phyla and on a data set of 312 spectra of 78
              strains measured before and after lyophilization and
              subculturing. SPeDE was able to dereplicate with high efficiency
              by identifying redundant spectra while retrieving reference
              spectra for all strains in a sample. SPeDE can identify
              distinguishing features between spectra, and its performance
              exceeds that of established methods in speed and precision. SPeDE
              is open source under the MIT license and is available from
              https://github.com/LM-UGent/SPeDEIMPORTANCE Estimation of the
              operational isolation units present in a MALDI-TOF mass spectral
              data set involves an essential dereplication step to identify
              redundant spectra in a rapid manner and without sacrificing
              biological resolution. We describe SPeDE, a new algorithm which
              facilitates culture-dependent clinical or environmental studies.
              SPeDE enables the rapid analysis and dereplication of isolates, a
              critical feature when long-term storage of cultures is limited or
              not feasible. We show that SPeDE can efficiently identify sets of
              similar spectra at the level of the species or strain, exceeding
              the taxonomic resolution of other methods. The high-throughput
              capacity, speed, and low cost of MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and
              SPeDE dereplication over traditional gene marker-based sequencing
              approaches should facilitate adoption of the culturomics approach
              to bacterial isolation campaigns.",

              is known about the biogeochemical implications of microbiomes in
              mangrove ecosystems, especially the variations between pristine
              and anthropogenic mangroves. To elucidate this, we investigated
              the microbial taxonomic and functional shifts of the mangrove
              microbiomes and their potential for bioactive compounds in two
              different coastal mangrove ecosystems in southern China. A gene
              catalogue, including 87 million unique genes, was constructed,
              based on deep shotgun metagenomic sequencing. Differentially
              enriched bacterial and archaeal taxa between pristine mangroves
              (Guangxi) and anthropogenic mangroves (Shenzhen) were found. The
              Nitrospira and ammonia-oxidizing archaea, specifically, were more
              abundant in Shenzhen mangroves, while sulfate-reducing bacteria
              and methanogens were more abundant in Guangxi mangroves. The
              results of functional analysis were consistent with the taxonomic
              results, indicating that the Shenzhen mangrove microbiome has a
              higher abundance of genes involved in nitrogen metabolism while
              the Guangxi mangrove microbiome has a higher capacity for sulfur
              metabolism and methanogenesis. Biosynthetic gene clusters were
              identified in the metagenome data and in hundreds of de novo
              reconstructed nonredundant microbial genomes, respectively.
              Notably, we found different biosynthetic potential in different
              taxa, and we identified three high quality and novel
              Acidobacteria genomes with a large number of BGCs. In total,
              67,278 unique genes were annotated with antibiotic resistance,
              indicating the prevalence and persistence in multidrug-resistant
              genes in the mangrove microbiome.IMPORTANCE This study
              comprehensively described the taxonomy and functionality of
              mangrove microbiomes, including their capacity for secondary
              metabolite biosynthesis and their ability to resist antibiotics.
              The microbial taxonomic and functional characteristics differed
              between geographical locations, corresponding to the
              environmental condition of two diverse mangrove regions. A large
              number of microbial biosynthetic gene clusters encoding novel
              bioactivities were found, and this can serve as a valuable

              genomes (MAGs) from the gut metagenomes of 180 predominantly wild
              animal species representing 5 classes, in addition to 14 existing
              animal gut metagenome data sets. The MAGs comprised 1,522
              species-level genome bins (SGBs), most of which were novel at the
              species, genus, or family level, and the majority were enriched

              SGBs enriched in host or environmental biomes, including the

              on a select few mammalian species (e.g., humans, mice, and
              cattle) have revealed a great deal of novel genomic diversity in
              the gut microbiome. However, little is known of the microbial
              diversity in the gut of other vertebrates. We studied the gut
              microbiomes of a large set of mostly wild animal species
              consisting of mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, and fish.
              Unfortunately, we found that existing reference databases
              commonly used for metagenomic analyses failed to capture the
              microbiome diversity among vertebrates. To increase database
              representation, we applied advanced metagenome assembly methods
              to our animal gut data and to many public gut metagenome data
              sets that had not been used to obtain microbial genomes. Our
              resulting genome and gene cluster collections comprised a great
              deal of novel taxonomic and genomic diversity, which we

  abstract = "Disease-suppressive soils protect plants against soilborne fungal
              pathogens that would otherwise cause root infections. Soil
              suppressiveness is, in most cases, mediated by the antagonistic
              activity of the microbial community associated with the plant
              roots. Considering the enormous taxonomic and functional
              diversity of the root-associated microbiome, identification of
              the microbial genera and mechanisms underlying this phenotype is
              challenging. One approach to unravel the underlying mechanisms is
              to identify metabolic pathways enriched in the
              disease-suppressive microbial community, in particular, pathways
              that harbor natural products with antifungal properties. An
              important class of these natural products includes peptides
              produced by nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs). Here, we
              applied functional amplicon sequencing of NRPS-associated
              adenylation domains (A domains) to a collection of eight soils
              that are suppressive or nonsuppressive (i.e., conducive) to
              Fusarium culmorum, a fungal root pathogen of wheat. To identify
              functional elements in the root-associated bacterial community,
              we developed an open-source pipeline, referred to as dom2BGC, for
              amplicon annotation and putative gene cluster reconstruction
              through analyzing A domain co-occurrence across samples. We
              applied this pipeline to rhizosphere communities from four
              disease-suppressive and four conducive soils and found
              significant similarities in NRPS repertoires between suppressive
              soils. Specifically, several siderophore biosynthetic gene
              clusters were consistently associated with suppressive soils,
              hinting at competition for iron as a potential mechanism of
              suppression. Finally, to validate dom2BGC and to allow more
              unbiased functional metagenomics, we performed 10$\times$
              metagenomic sequencing of one suppressive soil, leading to the
              identification of multiple gene clusters potentially associated
              with the disease-suppressive phenotype. IMPORTANCE Soil-borne
              plant-pathogenic fungi continue to be a major threat to
              agriculture and horticulture. The genus Fusarium in particular is
              one of the most devastating groups of soilborne fungal pathogens
              for a wide range of crops. Our approach to develop novel
              sustainable strategies to control this fungal root pathogen is to
              explore and exploit an effective, yet poorly understood naturally
              occurring protection, i.e., disease-suppressive soils. After
              screening 28 agricultural soils, we recently identified four
              soils that were suppressive to root disease of wheat caused by
              Fusarium culmorum. We also confirmed, via sterilization and
              transplantation, that the microbiomes of these soils play a
              significant role in the suppressive phenotype. By adopting
              nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) functional amplicon
              screening of suppressive and conducive soils, we here show how
              computationally driven comparative analysis of combined
              functional amplicon and metagenomic data can unravel putative
              mechanisms underlying microbiome-associated plant phenotypes.",

  abstract = "Stable isotope probing (SIP) facilitates culture-independent
              identification of active microbial populations within complex
              ecosystems through isotopic enrichment of nucleic acids. Many
              DNA-SIP studies rely on 16S rRNA gene sequences to identify
              active taxa, but connecting these sequences to specific bacterial
              genomes is often challenging. Here, we describe a standardized
              laboratory and analysis framework to quantify isotopic enrichment
              on a per-genome basis using shotgun metagenomics instead of 16S
              rRNA gene sequencing. To develop this framework, we explored
              various sample processing and analysis approaches using a
              designed microbiome where the identity of labeled genomes and
              their level of isotopic enrichment were experimentally
              controlled. With this ground truth dataset, we empirically
              assessed the accuracy of different analytical models for
              identifying active taxa and examined how sequencing depth impacts
              the detection of isotopically labeled genomes. We also
              demonstrate that using synthetic DNA internal standards to
              measure absolute genome abundances in SIP density fractions
              improves estimates of isotopic enrichment. In addition, our study
              illustrates the utility of internal standards to reveal anomalies
              in sample handling that could negatively impact SIP metagenomic
              analyses if left undetected. Finally, we present SIPmg, an R
              package to facilitate the estimation of absolute abundances and
              perform statistical analyses for identifying labeled genomes
              within SIP metagenomic data. This experimentally validated
              analysis framework strengthens the foundation of DNA-SIP
              metagenomics as a tool for accurately measuring the in situ
              activity of environmental microbial populations and assessing
              their genomic potential. IMPORTANCE Answering the questions,
              ``who is eating what?'' and ``who is active?'' within complex
              microbial communities is paramount for our ability to model,
              predict, and modulate microbiomes for improved human and
              planetary health. These questions can be pursued using stable
              isotope probing to track the incorporation of labeled compounds
              into cellular DNA during microbial growth. However, with
              traditional stable isotope methods, it is challenging to
              establish links between an active microorganism's taxonomic
              identity and genome composition while providing quantitative
              estimates of the microorganism's isotope incorporation rate.
              Here, we report an experimental and analytical workflow that lays
              the foundation for improved detection of metabolically active
              microorganisms and better quantitative estimates of
              genome-resolved isotope incorporation, which can be used to
              further refine ecosystem-scale models for carbon and nutrient
              fluxes within microbiomes.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: The general method used to determine the function of
              newly discovered proteins is to transfer annotations from
              well-characterized homologous proteins. The process of selecting
              homologous proteins can largely be classified into sequence-based
              and domain-based approaches. Domain-based methods have several
              advantages for identifying distant homology and homology among
              proteins with multiple domains, as compared to sequence-based
              methods. However, these methods are challenged by large families
              defined by 'promiscuous' (or 'mobile') domains. RESULTS: Here we
              present a measure, called Weighed Domain Architecture Comparison
              (WDAC), of domain architecture similarity, which can be used to
              identify homolog of multidomain proteins. To distinguish these
              promiscuous domains from conventional protein domains, we
              assigned a weight score to Pfam domain extracted from RefSeq
              proteins, based on its abundance and versatility. To measure the
              similarity of two domain architectures, cosine similarity (a
              similarity measure used in information retrieval) is used. We
              combined sequence similarity with domain architecture comparisons
              to identify proteins belonging to the same domain architecture.
              Using human and nematode proteomes, we compared WDAC with an
              unweighted domain architecture method (DAC) to evaluate the
              effectiveness of domain weight scores. We found that WDAC is
              better at identifying homology among multidomain proteins.
              CONCLUSION: Our analysis indicates that considering domain weight
              scores in domain architecture comparisons improves protein
              homology identification. We developed a web-based server to allow

              synthase (PKS) and nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) family
              of enzymes constitute several classes of therapeutically
              important natural products like erythromycin, rapamycin,
              cyclosporine etc. In view of their relevance for natural product
              based drug discovery, identification of novel secondary
              metabolite natural products by genome mining has been an area of
              active research. A number of different tailoring enzymes catalyze
              a variety of chemical modifications to the polyketide or
              nonribosomal peptide backbone of these secondary metabolites to
              enhance their structural diversity. Therefore, development of
              powerful bioinformatics methods for identification of these
              tailoring enzymes and assignment of their substrate specificity
              is crucial for deciphering novel secondary metabolites by genome
              mining. RESULTS: In this work, we have carried out a
              comprehensive bioinformatics analysis of methyltransferase (MT)
              domains present in multi functional type I PKS and NRPS proteins
              encoded by PKS/NRPS gene clusters having known secondary
              metabolite products. Based on the results of this analysis, we
              have developed a novel knowledge based computational approach for
              detecting MT domains present in PKS and NRPS megasynthases,
              delineating their correct boundaries and classifying them as
              N-MT, C-MT and O-MT using profile HMMs. Analysis of proteins in
              nr database of NCBI using these class specific profiles has
              revealed several interesting examples, namely, C-MT domains in
              NRPS modules, N-MT domains with significant homology to C-MT
              proteins, and presence of NRPS/PKS MTs in association with other
              catalytic domains. Our analysis of the chemical structures of the
              secondary metabolites and their site of methylation suggested
              that a possible evolutionary basis for the presence of a novel
              class of N-MT domains with significant homology to C-MT proteins
              could be the close resemblance of the chemical structures of the
              acceptor substrates, as in the case of pyochelin and
              yersiniabactin. These two classes of MTs recognize similar
              acceptor substrates, but transfer methyl groups to N and C
              positions on these substrates. CONCLUSION: We have developed a
              novel knowledge based computational approach for identifying MT
              domains present in type I PKS and NRPS multifunctional enzymes
              and predicting their site of methylation. Analysis of nr database
              using this approach has revealed presence of several novel MT
              domains. Our analysis has also given interesting insight into the
              evolutionary basis of the novel substrate specificities of these
              MT proteins.",

              World Wide Web and the cellular metabolism, as networks has
              recently uncovered a set of generic organizing principles: Most
              of these systems are scale-free while at the same time modular,
              resulting in a hierarchical architecture. The structure of the
              protein domain network, where individual domains correspond to
              nodes and their co-occurrences in a protein are interpreted as
              links, also falls into this category, suggesting that domains
              involved in the maintenance of increasingly developed,
              multicellular organisms accumulate links. Here, we take the next
              step by studying link based properties of the protein domain
              co-occurrence networks of the eukaryotes S. cerevisiae, C.
              elegans, D. melanogaster, M. musculus and H. sapiens. RESULTS: We
              construct the protein domain co-occurrence networks from the PFAM
              database and analyze them by applying a k-core decomposition
              method that isolates the globally central (highly connected
              domains in the central cores) from the locally central (highly
              connected domains in the peripheral cores) protein domains
              through an iterative peeling process. Furthermore, we compare the
              subnetworks thus obtained to the physical domain interaction
              network of S. cerevisiae. We find that the innermost cores of the
              domain co-occurrence networks gradually grow with increasing
              degree of evolutionary development in going from single cellular
              to multicellular eukaryotes. The comparison of the cores across
              all the organisms under consideration uncovers patterns of domain

              such as cell-cell contacts and signal transduction. Analyzing a
              weighted interaction network of PFAM domains of yeast, we find
              that domains having only a few partners frequently interact with
              these, while the converse is true for domains with a multitude of
              partners. Combining domain co-occurrence and interaction
              information, we observe that the co-occurrence of domains in the
              innermost cores (globally central domains) strongly coincides
              with physical interaction. The comparison of the multicellular
              eukaryotic domain co-occurrence networks with the single celled
              of S. cerevisiae (the overlap network) uncovers small, connected
              network patterns. CONCLUSION: We hypothesize that these patterns,
              consisting of the domains and links preserved through evolution,
              may constitute nucleation kernels for the evolutionary increase
              in proteome complexity. Combining co-occurrence and physical
              interaction data we argue that the driving force behind domain
              fusions is a collective effect caused by the number of
              interactions and not the individual interaction frequency.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Genome-scale prediction of gene regulation and
              reconstruction of transcriptional regulatory networks in
              prokaryotes is one of the critical tasks of modern genomics.
              Bacteria from different taxonomic groups, whose lifestyles and
              natural environments are substantially different, possess highly
              diverged transcriptional regulatory networks. The comparative
              genomics approaches are useful for in silico reconstruction of
              bacterial regulons and networks operated by both transcription
              factors (TFs) and RNA regulatory elements (riboswitches).
              DESCRIPTION: RegPrecise (http://regprecise.lbl.gov) is a web
              resource for collection, visualization and analysis of
              transcriptional regulons reconstructed by comparative genomics.
              We significantly expanded a reference collection of manually
              curated regulons we introduced earlier. RegPrecise 3.0 provides
              access to inferred regulatory interactions organized by
              phylogenetic, structural and functional properties.
              Taxonomy-specific collections include 781 TF regulogs inferred in
              more than 160 genomes representing 14 taxonomic groups of
              Bacteria. TF-specific collections include regulogs for a selected
              subset of 40 TFs reconstructed across more than 30 taxonomic
              lineages. Novel collections of regulons operated by RNA
              regulatory elements (riboswitches) include near 400 regulogs
              inferred in 24 bacterial lineages. RegPrecise 3.0 provides four
              classifications of the reference regulons implemented as
              controlled vocabularies: 55 TF protein families; 43 RNA motif
              families; ~150 biological processes or metabolic pathways; and
              ~200 effectors or environmental signals. Genome-wide
              visualization of regulatory networks and metabolic pathways
              covered by the reference regulons are available for all studied
              genomes. A separate section of RegPrecise 3.0 contains draft
              regulatory networks in 640 genomes obtained by an conservative
              propagation of the reference regulons to closely related genomes.
              CONCLUSIONS: RegPrecise 3.0 gives access to the transcriptional
              regulons reconstructed in bacterial genomes. Analytical
              capabilities include exploration of: regulon content, structure
              and function; TF binding site motifs; conservation and variations
              in genome-wide regulatory networks across all taxonomic groups of
              Bacteria. RegPrecise 3.0 was selected as a core resource on
              transcriptional regulation of the Department of Energy Systems
              Biology Knowledgebase, an emerging software and data environment
              designed to enable researchers to collaboratively generate, test
              and share new hypotheses about gene and protein functions,

              Due to the extensive within-species diversity in the microbial
              world, the pan-genome is often many times larger than a single
              genome. Studies of pan-genomes have become popular due to the
              easy access to whole-genome sequence data for prokaryotes. A
              pan-genome study reveals species diversity and gene families that
              may be of special interest, e.g because of their role in

              single-instruction multiple-data (SIMD) vectorized implementation
              of the Viterbi algorithm for profile HMM alignment and introduced
              various other speed-ups. These accelerated the search methods

              functions are common across microbial genomes and occur in
              genomes of larger eukaryotes as well. Important examples include
              Biosynthetic Gene Clusters (BGCs) that produce specialized
              metabolites with medicinal, agricultural, and industrial value
              (e.g. antimicrobials). Comparative analysis of BGCs can aid in
              the discovery of novel metabolites by highlighting distribution
              and identifying variants in public genomes. Unfortunately,
              gene-cluster-level homology detection remains inaccessible,
              time-consuming and difficult to interpret. RESULTS: The
              comparative gene cluster analysis toolbox (CAGECAT) is a rapid
              and user-friendly platform to mitigate difficulties in
              comparative analysis of whole gene clusters. The software
              provides homology searches and downstream analyses without the
              need for command-line or programming expertise. By leveraging
              remote BLAST databases, which always provide up-to-date results,
              CAGECAT can yield relevant matches that aid in the comparison,
              taxonomic distribution, or evolution of an unknown query. The
              service is extensible and interoperable and implements the
              cblaster and clinker pipelines to perform homology search,
              filtering, gene neighbourhood estimation, and dynamic
              visualisation of resulting variant BGCs. With the visualisation
              module, publication-quality figures can be customized directly
              from a web-browser, which greatly accelerates their
              interpretation via informative overlays to identify conserved
              genes in a BGC query. CONCLUSION: Overall, CAGECAT is an
              extensible software that can be interfaced via a standard
              web-browser for whole region homology searches and comparison on
              continually updated genomes from NCBI. The public web server and

              biosynthetic gene clusters that might encode compounds with
              valuable functions for industrial and medical applications. With
              the continuously increasing number of genomes sequenced, we are
              confronted with an overwhelming number of predicted clusters. In
              order to guide the effective prioritization of biosynthetic gene
              clusters towards finding the most promising compounds, knowledge
              about diversity, phylogenetic relationships and distribution
              patterns of biosynthetic gene clusters is necessary. RESULTS:
              Here, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the model
              actinobacterial genus Amycolatopsis and its potential for the
              production of secondary metabolites. A phylogenetic
              characterization, together with a pan-genome analysis showed that
              within this highly diverse genus, four major lineages could be
              distinguished which differed in their potential to produce
              secondary metabolites. Furthermore, we were able to distinguish
              gene cluster families whose distribution correlated with
              phylogeny, indicating that vertical gene transfer plays a major
              role in the evolution of secondary metabolite gene clusters.
              Still, the vast majority of the diverse biosynthetic gene
              clusters were derived from clusters unique to the genus, and also
              unique in comparison to a database of known compounds. Our study
              on the locations of biosynthetic gene clusters in the genomes of
              Amycolatopsis' strains showed that clusters acquired by
              horizontal gene transfer tend to be incorporated into
              non-conserved regions of the genome thereby allowing us to
              distinguish core and hypervariable regions in Amycolatopsis
              genomes. CONCLUSIONS: Using a comparative genomics approach, it
              was possible to determine the potential of the genus
              Amycolatopsis to produce a huge diversity of secondary
              metabolites. Furthermore, the analysis demonstrates that
              horizontal and vertical gene transfer play an important role in
              the acquisition and maintenance of valuable secondary
              metabolites. Our results cast light on the interconnections
              between secondary metabolite gene clusters and provide a way to
              prioritize biosynthetic pathways in the search and discovery of
              novel compounds.",

              comparative genomics analyses. While the authors of software for
              the quick comparison of protein sequences evaluate the speed of
              their software and compare their results against the most usual
              software for the task, it is not common for them to evaluate
              their software for more particular uses, such as finding
              orthologs as reciprocal best hits (RBH). Here we compared RBH
              results obtained using software that runs faster than blastp.
              Namely, lastal, diamond, and MMseqs2. RESULTS: We found that
              lastal required the least time to produce results. However, it
              yielded fewer results than any other program when comparing the
              proteins encoded by evolutionarily distant genomes. The program
              producing the most similar number of RBH to blastp was diamond
              ran with the ``ultra-sensitive'' option. However, this option was
              diamond's slowest, with the ``very-sensitive'' option offering
              the best balance between speed and RBH results. The speeding up
              of the programs was much more evident when dealing with
              eukaryotic genomes, which code for more numerous proteins. For
              example, lastal took a median of approx. 1.5\% of the blastp time
              to run with bacterial proteomes and 0.6\% with eukaryotic ones,
              while diamond with the very-sensitive option took 7.4\% and
              5.2\%, respectively. Though estimated error rates were very
              similar among the RBH obtained with all programs, RBH obtained
              with MMseqs2 had the lowest error rates among the programs
              tested. CONCLUSIONS: The fast algorithms for pairwise protein
              comparison produced results very similar to blast in a fraction
              of the time, with diamond offering the best compromise in speed,
              sensitivity and quality, as long as a sensitivity option, other

               genes",
  author    = "Cooley, Nicholas P and Wright, Erik S",
  abstract  = "Background Microbial genomes are largely comprised of protein
               coding sequences, yet some genomes contain many pseudogenes
               caused by frameshifts or internal stop codons. These pseudogenes
               are believed to result from gene degradation during evolution
               but could also be technical artifacts of genome sequencing or
               assembly. Results Using a combination of observational and
               experimental data, we show that many putative pseudogenes are
               attributable to errors that are incorporated into genomes during
               assembly. Within 126,564 publicly available genomes, we observed
               that nearly identical genomes often substantially differed in
               pseudogene counts. Causal inference implicated assembler,
               sequencing platform, and coverage as likely causative factors.
               Reassembly of genomes from raw reads confirmed that each
               variable affects the number of putative pseudogenes in an
               assembly. Furthermore, simulated sequencing reads corroborated
               our observations that the quality and quantity of raw data can
               significantly impact the number of pseudogenes in an assembler
               dependent fashion. The number of unexpected pseudogenes due to
               internal stops was highly correlated (R2 = 0.96) with average
               nucleotide identity to the ground truth genome, implying
               relative pseudogene counts can be used as a proxy for overall
               assembly correctness. Applying our method to assemblies in
               RefSeq resulted in rejection of 3.6\% of assemblies due to
               significantly elevated pseudogene counts. Reassembly from real
               reads obtained from high coverage genomes showed considerable
               variability in spurious pseudogenes beyond that observed with
               simulated reads, reinforcing the finding that high coverage is
               necessary to mitigate assembly errors. Conclusions Collectively,
               these results demonstrate that many pseudogenes in microbial
               genome assemblies are actually genes. Our results suggest that
               high read coverage is required for correct assembly and indicate
               an inflated number of pseudogenes due to internal stops is
               indicative of poor overall assembly quality.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Nematodes represent important pathogens of humans and
              farmed animals and cause significant health and economic impacts.
              The control of nematodes is primarily carried out by applying a
              limited number of anthelmintic compounds, for which there is now
              widespread resistance being reported. There is a current unmet
              need to develop novel control measures including the
              identification and characterisation of natural pathogens of
              nematodes. RESULTS: Nematode killing bacilli were isolated from a
              rotten fruit in association with wild free-living nematodes.
              These bacteria belong to the Chryseobacterium genus (golden
              bacteria) and represent a new species named Chryseobacterium
              nematophagum. These bacilli are oxidase-positive,
              flexirubin-pigmented, gram-negative rods that exhibit gelatinase
              activity. Caenorhabditis elegans are attracted to and eat these
              bacteria. Within 3 h of ingestion, however, the bacilli have
              degraded the anterior pharyngeal chitinous lining and entered the
              body cavity, ultimately killing the host. Within 24 h, the
              internal contents of the worms are digested followed by the final
              digestion of the remaining cuticle over a 2-3-day period. These
              bacteria will also infect and kill bacterivorous free-living
              (L1-L3) stages of all tested parasitic nematodes including the
              important veterinary Trichostrongylids such as Haemonchus
              contortus and Ostertagia ostertagi. The bacteria exhibit potent
              collagen-digesting properties, and genome sequencing has
              identified novel metalloprotease, collagenase and chitinase
              enzymes representing potential virulence factors. CONCLUSIONS:
              Chryseobacterium nematophagum is a newly discovered pathogen of
              nematodes that rapidly kills environmental stages of a wide range
              of key nematode parasites. These bacilli exhibit a unique
              invasion process, entering the body via the anterior pharynx
              through the specific degradation of extracellular matrices. This
              bacterial pathogen represents a prospective biological control
              agent for important nematode parasites.",

              to the genomic differences within related bacteria. The human
              oral microbiome with its diverse habitats and abundant,

              approach that combines public genomes with Human Microbiome
              Project (HMP) metagenomes to study the diversity of microbial
              residents of three oral habitats: tongue dorsum, buccal mucosa,
              and supragingival plaque. For two exemplar taxa, Haemophilus
              parainfluenzae and the genus Rothia, metapangenomes reveal
              distinct genomic groups based on shared genome content. H.
              parainfluenzae genomes separate into three distinct subgroups
              with differential abundance between oral habitats. Functional
              enrichment analyses identify an operon encoding oxaloacetate
              decarboxylase as diagnostic for the tongue-abundant subgroup. For
              the genus Rothia, grouping by shared genome content recapitulates
              species-level taxonomy and habitat preferences. However, while
              most R. mucilaginosa are restricted to the tongue as expected,
              two genomes represent a cryptic population of R. mucilaginosa in
              many buccal mucosa samples. For both H. parainfluenzae and the

              environment, but also specifically which cultivar gene sequences
              are absent or ubiquitous. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide
              insights into population structure and biogeography in the mouth
              and form specific hypotheses about habitat adaptation. These

              related to L. ferriphilum (sampling depth approximately 20x). The
              population is dominated by one sequence type, yet we detected
              evidence for relatively abundant variants (>99.5\% sequence
              identity to the dominant type) at multiple loci, and a few rare
              variants. Blocks of other Leptospirillum group II types (

              potential within the population arises from localized variation

              for experimental design of genes for the biosynthesis of new
              bioactive compounds. Here we address the question of how the
              modularity of biosynthetic enzymes and the prevalence of multiple
              gene clusters in Streptomyces drive the evolution of metabolic
              diversity. The phylogeny of ketosynthase (KS) domains of
              Streptomyces PKSs revealed that the majority of modules involved
              in the biosynthesis of a single compound evolved by duplication
              of a single ancestor module. Using Streptomyces avermitilis as a
              model organism, we have reconstructed the evolutionary
              relationships of different domain types. This analysis suggests
              that 65\% of the modules were altered by recombinational
              replacements that occurred within and between biosynthetic gene
              clusters. The natural reprogramming of the biosynthetic pathways

              could be identified in interdomain regions and within domains.
              Our results indicate that homologous recombination facilitated by

  abstract = "We address the problem of homology identification in complex
              multidomain families with varied domain architectures. The
              challenge is to distinguish sequence pairs that share common
              ancestry from pairs that share an inserted domain but are
              otherwise unrelated. This distinction is essential for accuracy
              in gene annotation, function prediction, and comparative
              genomics. There are two major obstacles to multidomain homology
              identification: lack of a formal definition and lack of curated
              benchmarks for evaluating the performance of new methods. We
              offer preliminary solutions to both problems: 1) an extension of
              the traditional model of homology to include domain insertions;
              and 2) a manually curated benchmark of well-studied families in
              mouse and human. We further present Neighborhood Correlation, a
              novel method that exploits the local structure of the sequence
              similarity network to identify homologs with great accuracy based
              on the observation that gene duplication and domain shuffling
              leave distinct patterns in the sequence similarity network. In a
              rigorous, empirical comparison using our curated data,
              Neighborhood Correlation outperforms sequence similarity,
              alignment length, and domain architecture comparison.
              Neighborhood Correlation is well suited for automated,
              genome-scale analyses. It is easy to compute, does not require
              explicit knowledge of domain architecture, and classifies both
              single and multidomain homologs with high accuracy. Homolog
              predictions obtained with our method, as well as our manually
              curated benchmark and a web-based visualization tool for
              exploratory analysis of the network neighborhood structure, are
              available at http://www.neighborhoodcorrelation.org. Our work
              represents a departure from the prevailing view that the concept
              of homology cannot be applied to genes that have undergone domain
              shuffling. In contrast to current approaches that either focus on
              the homology of individual domains or consider only families with
              identical domain architectures, we show that homology can be
              rationally defined for multidomain families with diverse
              architectures by considering the genomic context of the genes
              that encode them. Our study demonstrates the utility of mining
              network structure for evolutionary information, suggesting this
              is a fertile approach for investigating evolutionary processes in
              the post-genomic era.",

              of sequence database homology search. However, practical use of
              profile HMM methods has been hindered by the computational
              expense of existing software implementations. Here I describe an
              acceleration heuristic for profile HMMs, the ``multiple segment
              Viterbi'' (MSV) algorithm. The MSV algorithm computes an optimal
              sum of multiple ungapped local alignment segments using a striped
              vector-parallel approach previously described for fast
              Smith/Waterman alignment. MSV scores follow the same statistical
              distribution as gapped optimal local alignment scores, allowing
              rapid evaluation of significance of an MSV score and thus
              facilitating its use as a heuristic filter. I also describe a
              20-fold acceleration of the standard profile HMM Forward/Backward
              algorithms using a method I call ``sparse rescaling''. These
              methods are assembled in a pipeline in which high-scoring MSV
              hits are passed on for reanalysis with the full HMM
              Forward/Backward algorithm. This accelerated pipeline is
              implemented in the freely available HMMER3 software package.
              Performance benchmarks show that the use of the heuristic MSV
              filter sacrifices negligible sensitivity compared to
              unaccelerated profile HMM searches. HMMER3 is substantially more
              sensitive and 100- to 1000-fold faster than HMMER2. HMMER3 is now

              the successive merger of smaller sub-clusters, which function as
              independent evolutionary entities. 2) An important subset of

              products that are applied clinically, agriculturally, and
              industrially. The genes that encode their biosynthesis are often
              physically clustered on the genome in biosynthetic gene clusters
              (BGCs). Many BGCs consist of multiple groups of co-evolving genes
              called sub-clusters that are responsible for the biosynthesis of
              a specific chemical moiety in a natural product. Sub-clusters
              therefore provide an important link between the structures of a
              natural product and its BGC, which can be leveraged for
              predicting natural product structures from sequence, as well as
              for linking chemical structures and metabolomics-derived mass
              features to BGCs. While some initial computational methodologies
              have been devised for sub-cluster detection, current approaches
              are not scalable, have only been run on small and outdated
              datasets, or produce an impractically large number of possible
              sub-clusters to mine through. Here, we constructed a scalable
              method for unsupervised sub-cluster detection, called iPRESTO,
              based on topic modelling and statistical analysis of
              co-occurrence patterns of enzyme-coding protein families. iPRESTO
              was used to mine sub-clusters across 150,000 prokaryotic BGCs
              from antiSMASH-DB. After annotating a fraction of the resulting
              sub-cluster families, we could predict a substructure for 16\% of
              the antiSMASH-DB BGCs. Additionally, our method was able to
              confirm 83\% of the experimentally characterised sub-clusters in
              MIBiG reference BGCs. Based on iPRESTO-detected sub-clusters, we
              could correctly identify the BGCs for xenorhabdin and salbostatin
              biosynthesis (which had not yet been annotated in BGC databases),
              as well as propose a candidate BGC for akashin biosynthesis.
              Additionally, we show for a collection of 145 actinobacteria how
              substructures can aid in linking BGCs to molecules by correlating
              iPRESTO-detected sub-clusters to MS/MS-derived Mass2Motifs

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: All-versus-all BLAST, which searches for homologous
              pairs of sequences in a database of proteins, is used to identify
              potential orthologs, to find new protein families, and to provide
              rapid access to these homology relationships. As DNA sequencing
              accelerates and data sets grow, all-versus-all BLAST has become
              computationally demanding. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We
              present FastBLAST, a heuristic replacement for all-versus-all
              BLAST that relies on alignments of proteins to known families,
              obtained from tools such as PSI-BLAST and HMMer. FastBLAST avoids
              most of the work of all-versus-all BLAST by taking advantage of
              these alignments and by clustering similar sequences. FastBLAST
              runs in two stages: the first stage identifies additional
              families and aligns them, and the second stage quickly identifies
              the homologs of a query sequence, based on the alignments of the
              families, before generating pairwise alignments. On 6.53 million
              proteins from the non-redundant Genbank database (``NR''),
              FastBLAST identifies new families 25 times faster than
              all-versus-all BLAST. Once the first stage is completed,
              FastBLAST identifies homologs for the average query in less than
              5 seconds (8.6 times faster than BLAST) and gives nearly
              identical results. For hits above 70 bits, FastBLAST identifies
              98\% of the top 3,250 hits per query. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE:
              FastBLAST enables research groups that do not have supercomputers
              to analyze large protein sequence data sets. FastBLAST is open
              source software and is available at

              marker in microbial ecology, its poor resolution is still not
              fully understood at the intra-genus level. In this work, the
              number of rRNA gene operons, intra-genomic heterogeneities and
              lateral transfers were investigated at a fine-scale resolution,
              throughout the Pseudomonas genus. In addition to nineteen
              sequenced Pseudomonas strains, we determined the 16S rRNA copy
              number in four other Pseudomonas strains by Southern
              hybridization and Pulsed-Field Gel Electrophoresis, and studied
              the intra-genomic heterogeneities by Denaturing Gradient Gel
              Electrophoresis and sequencing. Although the variable copy number
              (from four to seven) seems to be correlated with the evolutionary
              distance, some close strains in the P. fluorescens lineage showed
              a different number of 16S rRNA genes, whereas all the strains in
              the P. aeruginosa lineage displayed the same number of genes
              (four copies). Further study of the intra-genomic heterogeneities
              revealed that most of the Pseudomonas strains (15 out of 19
              strains) had at least two different 16S rRNA alleles. A great
              difference (5 or 19 nucleotides, essentially grouped near the V1
              hypervariable region) was observed only in two sequenced strains.
              In one of our strains studied (MFY30 strain), we found a
              difference of 12 nucleotides (grouped in the V3 hypervariable
              region) between copies of the 16S rRNA gene. Finally, occurrence
              of partial lateral transfers of the 16S rRNA gene was further
              investigated in 1803 full-length sequences of Pseudomonas
              available in the databases. Remarkably, we found that the two
              most variable regions (the V1 and V3 hypervariable regions) had
              probably been laterally transferred from another evolutionary
              distant Pseudomonas strain for at least 48.3 and 41.6\% of the
              16S rRNA sequences, respectively. In conclusion, we strongly
              recommend removing these regions of the 16S rRNA gene during the
              intra-genus diversity studies.",

              operons, however, the classification and annotation of individual
              loci remains problematic. Here we describe a classification model
              based on usher phylogeny and genomic locus position to categorise
              the CU fimbrial types of E. coli. Using the BLASTp algorithm, an
              iterative usher protein search was performed to identify CU
              fimbrial operons from 35 E. coli (and one Escherichia
              fergusonnii) genomes representing different pathogenic and
              phylogenic lineages, as well as 132 Escherichia spp. plasmids. A
              total of 458 CU fimbrial operons were identified, which represent
              38 distinct fimbrial types based on genomic locus position and
              usher phylogeny. The majority of fimbrial operon types occupied a
              specific locus position on the E. coli chromosome; exceptions

              Type 1, Yad, Yeh, Yfc, Mat, F9 and Ybg fimbriae. These genes were
              present as intact or disrupted operons at the same genetic locus

              Drastically reduced symbiont genomes and metabolic
              complementarity among the symbionts and D. citri indicate their
              mutually indispensable association. Moreover, horizontal gene

              Carsonella during transovarial transmission and the development
              of D. citri. In the bacteriomes of sexually-mature female adults,
              symbionts transformed from an extremely elongated tubular form

              Carsonella and Profftella migrated to the central and peripheral
              parts of the mass, respectively. Following the appearance of host
              nuclei, the mass cellularized, segregating Carsonella and
              Profftella in the central syncytium and peripheral uninucleate
              bacteriocytes, respectively. Subsequently, the uninucleate
              bacteriocytes harboring Profftella assembled at the posterior
              pole, while the syncytium, containing Carsonella, sat on the
              anterior side facing the germ band initiating katatrepsis. During
              dorsal closure, the syncytium was divided into uninuclear

              containing Profftella. Once fully surrounded, the bacteriocyte
              mass containing Profftella was fused into a syncytium. Prior to

              psyllid Diaphorina citri (Hemiptera: Liviidae). Diaphorin belongs
              to the pederin family, a group of compounds that share much of
              their core structure with that of pederin, which is characterized
              by two dihydropyran rings bridged by an N-acyl aminal. Most
              members of this family have potent antitumor activity, making
              them promising anticancer drug candidates. The present study
              assessed the therapeutic potential of diaphorin for its antitumor
              activity against 39 human cancer cell lines including those from
              breast, brain, colon, lung, skin, ovary, kidney, stomach, and

              activity against all 39 cancer cell lines tested. The GI50, TGI,

              values are among the highest in the pederin family, indicating
              that the anticancer activity of diaphorin is milder than those of
              other pederin congeners. The inhibitory effects of diaphorin
              significantly differed among the distinct cancer types. The
              maximum difference was about 10-fold, which was similar to those

              fungal virulence",
  author   = "Schneiter, Roger and Di Pietro, Antonio",
  abstract = "CAP superfamily proteins, also known as sperm-coating proteins,
              are found in all kingdoms of life and have been implicated in a
              variety of physiological contexts, including immune defense in
              plants and mammals, sperm maturation and fertilization, fungal
              virulence, and toxicity of insect and reptile venoms as well as
              prostate and brain cancer. CAP family members are mostly secreted
              glycoproteins that are highly stable in the extracellular fluid.
              All members of the superfamily share a common CAP domain of
              approximately 150 amino acids, which adopts a unique
              $\alpha$-$\beta$-$\alpha$ sandwich fold. The conserved structure
              suggests that CAP proteins exert fundamentally similar functions.
              However, the molecular mode of action of this protein family has
              remained enigmatic. The budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae
              has three CAP family members designated Pry (pathogen related in
              yeast), and recent evidence indicates that they act as
              sterol-binding and export proteins. Expression of the mammalian
              CAP protein CRISP2, which binds sterols in vitro, complements the
              sterol export defect of a yeast pry mutant, suggesting that
              sterol binding and export is conserved among different CAP family
              members. Collectively, these observations suggest that CAP family
              members constitute a novel class of secreted extracellular
              sterol-binding proteins. A ligand-binding activity of the CAP
              domain could explain many of the biological activities attributed
              to these proteins. For example, the strong induction of plant
              pathogenesis-related 1 protein upon exposure to pathogens may
              serve to inhibit pathogen proliferation by extracting sterols
              from the pathogen membrane. Similarly, the presence of these
              proteins in the venom of toxic insects and reptiles or in the
              secretome of pathogenic fungi might inflict damage by
              sequestering sterols or related small hydrophobic compounds from
              the host tissue.",

              are among the most important sources of biomedically relevant
              natural products. However, as these animals generally contain
              only low quantities of the compounds, further pharmacological
              development is in most cases difficult. There is increasing
              evidence that many metabolites, in particular polyketides and
              nonribosomally synthesized peptides, are not produced by the
              animals themselves but by associated bacterial symbionts. This
              symbiont hypothesis currently attracts considerable interest,
              since it implicates that animal-independent production systems
              based on bacterial fermentation processes could be created. This
              review gives an overview about recent developments in the
              research on natural product symbiosis. Different techniques will
              be discussed that have been employed to pinpoint the actual
              producer. Since bacterial symbionts are highly fastidious and
              have been generally resistant to cultivation attempts, emphasis
              will be laid on culture-independent strategies, such as cell
              separation approaches and the cloning of biosynthetic genes.
              These strategies have provided insights into possible sources of
              several natural products, e.g. the bryostatins, pederin, the
              onnamides, swinholide A and theopalauamide. Finally, potential
              techniques for the generation of renewable supplies of
              symbiont-derived drug candidates will be discussed. Cultivation
              approaches and the heterologous expression of cloned biosynthesis
              genes from uncultured symbionts could in future provide access to
              several important marine drug candidates, including bryostatin 1,

               an impressive history of adaptation to intracellular lifestyles.
               Instead of adapting to a single host lineage, Wolbachia evolved
               ways to jump across host species and establish relatively stable
               associations maintained through vertical transmission. Wolbachia
               are capable of manipulating the reproduction of infected hosts
               in a remarkable way. Traditionally, such reproductive
               manipulations have been regarded as the general mechanism by
               which Wolbachia spread through host populations. Recent evidence
               suggests that Wolbachia-host interactions are more complex than
               previously thought and may be driven by the onset and resolution
               of conflicts of interest. Here, we discuss how reproductive
               manipulation phenotypes may be transient. As the host adapts to
               infection, manipulation phenotypes attenuate and the continuity
               of the symbioses may rely on the physiological advantages
               Wolbachia may confer to their host. For facultative symbionts,
               such benefits are likely to be dependent on the environment.
               Here, we also review evidence that supports the view of
               environment-dependent facultative mutualism as a stable
               evolutionary outcome of Wolbachia infections beside extinction
               and obligate symbioses. Finally, our current understanding of
               the biology of mitochondria and Wolbachia unravels remarkable
               parallels in the way they interact with the nuclear genome.
               Great insights into both the Wolbachia and mitochondrial

              cultures. In nature, cross feeding and competition are important
              aspects of microbial physiology and these can only be addressed
              by studying complete communities such as enrichment cultures.
              Metagenomic sequencing is a powerful tool to characterize such
              mixed cultures. In the analysis of metagenomic data, well
              established algorithms exist for the assembly of short reads into
              contigs and for the annotation of predicted genes. However, the
              binning of the assembled contigs or unassembled reads is still a
              major bottleneck and required to understand how the overall
              metabolism is partitioned over different community members.
              Binning consists of the clustering of contigs or reads that
              apparently originate from the same source population. In the
              present study eight metagenomic samples from the same habitat, a
              laboratory enrichment culture, were sequenced. Each sample
              contained 13-23 Mb of assembled contigs and up to eight abundant
              populations. Binning was attempted with existing methods but they
              were found to produce poor results, were slow, dependent on
              non-standard platforms or produced errors. A new binning
              procedure was developed based on multivariate statistics of
              tetranucleotide frequencies combined with the use of interpolated

              results between samples with BLAST and in comparison to existing
              algorithms for four publicly available metagenomes and one
              previously published artificial metagenome. The accuracy of the
              new approach was comparable or higher than existing methods.
              Further, it was up to a 100 times faster. It was implemented in
              Java Swing as a complete open source graphical binning

              years of employing metagenomics for marine drug discovery, new

                 toward meeting the challenge of understanding gene function
                 and regulation is the identification of sets of genes that are
                 always co-expressed. These gene sets, Atomic Regulons (ARs),
                 represent fundamental units of function within a cell and
                 could be used to associate genes of unknown function with
                 cellular processes and to enable rational genetic engineering
                 of cellular systems. Here, we describe an approach for
                 inferring ARs that leverages large-scale expression data sets,
                 gene context, and functional relationships among genes. We
                 computed ARs for Escherichia coli based on 907 gene expression
                 experiments and compared our results with gene clusters
                 produced by two prevalent data-driven methods: Hierarchical
                 clustering and k-means clustering. We compared ARs and purely
                 data-driven gene clusters to the curated set of regulatory
                 interactions for E. coli found in RegulonDB, showing that ARs
                 are more consistent with gold standard regulons than are
                 data-driven gene clusters. We further examined the consistency
                 of ARs and data-driven gene clusters in the context of gene
                 interactions predicted by Context Likelihood of Relatedness
                 (CLR) analysis, finding that the ARs show better agreement
                 with CLR predicted interactions. We determined the impact of
                 increasing amounts of expression data on AR construction and
                 find that while more data improve ARs, it is not necessary to
                 use the full set of gene expression experiments available for
                 E. coli to produce high quality ARs. In order to explore the
                 conservation of co-regulated gene sets across different
                 organisms, we computed ARs for Shewanella oneidensis,
                 Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Thermus thermophilus, and
                 Staphylococcus aureus, each of which represents increasing
                 degrees of phylogenetic distance from E. coli. Comparison of
                 the organism-specific ARs showed that the consistency of AR
                 gene membership correlates with phylogenetic distance, but
                 there is clear variability in the regulatory networks of
                 closely related organisms. As large scale expression data sets
                 become increasingly common for model and non-model organisms,
                 comparative analyses of atomic regulons will provide valuable

  abstract    = "Streptomyces bacteria make numerous secondary metabolites,
                 including half of all known antibiotics. Production of
                 antibiotics is usually coordinated with the onset of
                 sporulation but the cross regulation of these processes is not
                 fully understood. This is important because most Streptomyces
                 antibiotics are produced at low levels or not at all under
                 laboratory conditions and this makes large scale production of
                 these compounds very challenging. Here, we characterize the
                 highly conserved actinobacterial two-component system MtrAB in
                 the model organism Streptomyces venezuelae and provide
                 evidence that it coordinates production of the antibiotic
                 chloramphenicol with sporulation. MtrAB are known to
                 coordinate DNA replication and cell division in Mycobacterium
                 tuberculosis where TB-MtrA is essential for viability but MtrB
                 is dispensable. We deleted mtrB in S. venezuelae and this
                 resulted in a global shift in the metabolome, including
                 constitutive, higher-level production of chloramphenicol. We
                 found that chloramphenicol is detectable in the wild-type
                 strain, but only at very low levels and only after it has
                 sporulated. ChIP-seq showed that MtrA binds upstream of DNA
                 replication and cell division genes and genes required for
                 chloramphenicol production. dnaA, dnaN, oriC, and wblE (whiB1)
                 are DNA binding targets for MtrA in both M. tuberculosis and
                 S. venezuelae. Intriguingly, over-expression of TB-MtrA and
                 gain of function TB- and Sv-MtrA proteins in S. venezuelae
                 also switched on higher-level production of chloramphenicol.
                 Given the conservation of MtrAB, these constructs might be
                 useful tools for manipulating antibiotic production in other

              Recently, metagenomic surveys and other culture-independent
              methods have begun to describe the distribution and diversity of
              microbial metabolism across environmental conditions, often using
              16S rRNA gene as a marker to group bacteria into taxonomic units.
              However, the extent to which similarity at the conserved

              phylogeny, metabolic diversity, and ecologically relevant gene
              content remains contentious. Here, we examine the relationship
              between 16S identity, core genome divergence, and metabolic gene
              content across the ancient and ecologically important genus
              Streptomyces. We assessed and quantified the high variability of

  abstract = "Soil dwelling Streptomyces species are faced with large
              variations in carbon or nitrogen sources, phosphate, oxygen,
              iron, sulfur, and other nutrients. These drastic changes in key
              nutrients result in an unbalanced metabolism that have
              undesirable consequences for growth, cell differentiation,
              reproduction, and secondary metabolites biosynthesis. In the last
              decades evidence has accumulated indicating that mechanisms to
              correct metabolic unbalances in Streptomyces species take place
              at the transcriptional level, mediated by different
              transcriptional factors. For example, the master regulator PhoP
              and the large SARP-type regulator AfsR bind to overlapping
              sequences in the afsS promoter and, therefore, compete in the
              integration of signals of phosphate starvation and
              S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) concentrations. The cross-talk between
              phosphate control of metabolism, mediated by the PhoR-PhoP
              system, and the pleiotropic orphan nitrogen regulator GlnR, is
              very interesting; PhoP represses GlnR and other nitrogen
              metabolism genes. The mechanisms of control by GlnR of several
              promoters of ATP binding cassettes (ABC) sugar transporters and
              carbon metabolism are highly elaborated. Another important
              cross-talk that governs nitrogen metabolism involves the
              competition between GlnR and the transcriptional factor MtrA.
              GlnR and MtrA exert opposite effects on expression of nitrogen
              metabolism genes. MtrA, under nitrogen rich conditions, represses
              expression of nitrogen assimilation and regulatory genes,
              including GlnR, and competes with GlnR for the GlnR binding
              sites. Strikingly, these sites also bind to PhoP. Novel examples
              of interacting transcriptional factors, discovered recently, are
              discussed to provide a broad view of this interactions.
              Altogether, these findings indicate that cross-talks between the
              major transcriptional factors protect the cell metabolic balance.
              A detailed analysis of the transcriptional factors binding
              sequences suggests that the transcriptional factors interact with
              specific regions, either by overlapping the recognition sequence
              of other factors or by binding to adjacent sites in those
              regions. Additional interactions on the regulatory backbone are
              provided by sigma factors, highly phosphorylated nucleotides,
              cyclic dinucleotides, and small ligands that interact with
              cognate receptor proteins and with TetR-type transcriptional
              regulators. We propose to define the signal integration DNA
              regions (so called integrator sites) that assemble responses to
              different stress, nutritional or environmental signals. These
              integrator sites constitute nodes recognized by two, three, or
              more transcriptional factors to compensate the unbalances
              produced by metabolic stresses. This interplay mechanism acts as
              a safety net to prevent major damage to the metabolism under
              extreme nutritional and environmental conditions.",

              regulators are well-known activators of antibiotic biosynthesis
              in streptomycetes. The respective genes occur in various types of
              antibiotic gene clusters encoding, e.g., for polyketides,
              ribosomally and non-ribosomally synthesized peptides, or
              $\beta$-lactam antibiotics. We found that overexpression of the
              SARP-type regulator gene papR2 from Streptomyces
              pristinaespiralis in Streptomyces lividans leads to the
              activation of the silent undecylprodigiosin (Red) gene cluster.
              The activation happens upon the inducing function of PapR2, which
              takes over the regulatory role of RedD, the latter of which is
              the intrinsic SARP regulator of Red biosynthesis in S. lividans.
              Due to the broad abundance of SARP genes in different antibiotic
              gene clusters of various actinomycetes and the uniform activating
              principle of the encoded regulators, we suggest that this type of
              regulator is especially well suited to be used as an initiator of

  abstract = "Natural products have traditionally been discovered through the
              screening of culturable microbial isolates from diverse
              environments. The sequencing revolution allowed the
              identification of dozens of biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs)
              within single bacterial genomes, either from cultured or
              uncultured strains. However, we are still far from fully
              exploiting the microbial reservoir, as most of the species are
              non-model organisms with complex regulatory systems that can be
              recalcitrant to engineering approaches. Genomic and metagenomic
              data produced by laboratories worldwide covering the range of
              natural and artificial environments on Earth, are an invaluable
              source of raw information from which natural product biosynthesis
              can be accessed. In the present work, we describe the
              environmental distribution and evolution of the abyssomicin BGC
              through the analysis of publicly available genomic and
              metagenomic data. Our results demonstrate that the selection of a
              pathway-specific enzyme to direct genome mining is an excellent
              strategy; we identified 74 new Diels-Alderase homologs and
              unveiled a surprising prevalence of the abyssomicin BGC within
              terrestrial habitats, mainly soil and plant-associated. We also
              identified five complete and 12 partial new abyssomicin BGCs and
              23 new potential abyssomicin BGCs. Our results strongly support
              the potential of genome and metagenome mining as a key
              preliminary tool to inform bioprospecting strategies aimed at the

              clinical care and epidemiological investigations due to the
              different epidemic potentialities of a species. For this purpose,
              matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization - time-of-flight mass
              spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) has been proposed in place of
              molecular genotyping, but with some result discrepancies. The aim
              of this work is to methodically mine the expression diversities
              of MALDI-TOF bacterial species spectra and their possible latent
              organization in order to evaluate their subspecies specific
              expression. Peak expression diversities of MALDI-TOF spectra
              coming from routine identifications have been analyzed using Hill
              numbers, rarefaction curves, and peak clustering. Some size
              effect critical thresholds were estimated using change point
              analyses. We included 167,528 spectra corresponding to 405
              species. Species spectra diversities have a broad size-dependent
              variability, which may be influenced by the kind of sampling.
              Peak organization is characterized by the presence of a main
              cluster made of the most frequently co-occurring peaks and around
              20 secondary clusters grouping less frequently co-occurring
              peaks. The 35 most represented species in our sample are
              distributed in two groups depending on the focusing of their
              protein synthesis activity on the main cluster or not. Our
              results may advocate some analogy with genomics studies of
              bacteria, with a main species-related cluster of co-occurring
              peaks and several secondary clusters, which may host peaks able
              to discriminate bacterial subgroups. This systematic study of the
              expression diversities of MALDI-TOF spectra shows that latent
              organization of co-occurring peaks supports subspecies
              discrimination and may explain why studies on MALDI-TOF-based
              typing exhibit some result divergences.",

              microbiology, however, reconstructing complete genomes of
              organisms from whole metagenomic shotgun sequencing data remains
              a challenge. Recovered genomes are often highly fragmented, due
              to uneven abundances of organisms, repeats within and across
              genomes, sequencing errors, and strain-level variation. To
              address the fragmented nature of metagenomic assemblies,
              scientists rely on a process called binning, which clusters
              together contigs inferred to originate from the same organism.
              Existing binning algorithms use oligonucleotide frequencies and
              contig abundance (coverage) within and across samples to group
              together contigs from the same organism. However, these
              algorithms often miss short contigs and contigs from regions with
              unusual coverage or DNA composition characteristics, such as
              mobile elements. Here, we propose that information from assembly
              graphs can assist current strategies for metagenomic binning. We
              use MetaCarvel, a metagenomic scaffolding tool, to construct
              assembly graphs where contigs are nodes and edges are inferred
              based on paired-end reads. We developed a tool, Binnacle, that
              extracts information from the assembly graphs and clusters
              scaffolds into comprehensive bins. Binnacle also provides wrapper
              scripts to integrate with existing binning methods. The Binnacle
              pipeline can be found on GitHub
              (https://github.com/marbl/binnacle). We show that binning
              graph-based scaffolds, rather than contigs, improves the
              contiguity and quality of the resulting bins, and captures a
              broader set of the genes of the organisms being reconstructed.",

              One approach towards novel natural product discovery is to awaken
              these cryptic BGCs by re-wiring the regulatory control
              mechanism(s). Most CSRs bind intergenic regions of DNA in their
              own BGC to control compound biosynthesis, but some CSRs can
              control the biosynthesis of multiple natural products by binding
              to several different BGCs. These cross-cluster regulators present
              an opportunity for natural product discovery, as the expression
              of multiple BGCs can be affected through the manipulation of a
              single regulator. This review describes examples of these
              different mechanisms, including specific examples of
              cross-cluster regulation, and assesses the impact that this
              knowledge may have on the discovery of novel natural products.",

                 harboring chloramphenicol and jadomycin biosynthetic gene
                 clusters (BGC). With these high-quality genome sequences, we
                 revealed that the three strains share more than 85\% of total

                 we either anchored the bacterial chaperone DnaJ to the 3'
                 untranslated region of a target mRNA by fusing with an
                 RNA-binding domain in the chaperone-recruiting mRNA scaffold

              pseudogenes and are used to identify them. Here we show that
              in-frame stop codons within bacterial protein-coding genes are
              widespread. Their evolutionary conservation suggests that many of
              them are not pseudogenes, since they maintain dN/dS values
              (ratios of substitution rates at non-synonymous and synonymous
              sites) significantly lower than 1 (this is a signature of
              purifying selection in protein-coding regions). We also found
              that double substitutions in codons-where an intermediate step is
              a nonsense substitution-show a higher rate of evolution compared
              to null models, indicating that a stop codon was introduced and
              then changed back to sense via positive selection. This further
              supports the notion that nonsense substitutions in bacteria are
              relatively common and do not necessarily cause pseudogenization.
              In-frame stop codons may be an important mechanism of regulation:

              known natural product chemical entities has remained a
              significant obstacle to discovery efforts. A major contributing
              factor to this redundancy is the duplication of bacterial taxa in
              a library, which can be mitigated through the use of a variety of
              DNA sequencing strategies and/or mass spectrometry-informed
              bioinformatics platforms so that the library is created with
              minimal phylogenetic, and thus minimal natural product overlap.
              IDBac is a MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry-based bioinformatics
              platform used to assess overlap within collections of
              environmental bacterial isolates. It allows environmental isolate
              redundancy to be reduced while considering both phylogeny and
              natural product production. However, manually selecting isolates
              for addition to a library during this process was time intensive
              and left to the researcher's discretion. Here, we developed an
              algorithm that automates the prioritization of hundreds to
              thousands of environmental microorganisms in IDBac. The algorithm

              venom CRISPs are the most familiar members. Although CRISPs are

              been functionally characterized, but those that have been exhibit
              diverse activities. Snake venom CRISPs (svCRISPs) inhibit ion
              channels and the growth of new blood vessels (angiogenesis). They
              also increase vascular permeability and promote inflammatory

              of CRISP physiological activities throughout the animal kingdom.

              structures and sequence alignments, and we discuss predicted

  title    = "An alignment-free domain architecture similarity search ({ADASS})
              algorithm for inferring homology between multi-domain proteins",
  author   = "Syamaladevi, Divya P and Joshi, Adwait and Sowdhamini, Ramanathan",
  abstract = "Annotations of the genes and their products are largely guided by
              inferring homology. Sequence similarity is the primary measure
              used for annotation purpose however, the domain content and order
              were given less importance albeit the fact that domain insertion,
              deletion, positional changes can bring in functional varieties.
              Of late, several methods developed quantify domain architecture
              similarity depending on alignments of their sequences and are
              focused on only homologous proteins. We present an alignment-free
              domain architecture-similarity search (ADASS) algorithm that
              identifies proteins that share very poor sequence similarity yet
              having similar domain architectures. We introduce a ``singlet
              matching-triplet comparison'' method in ADASS, wherein triplet of
              domains is compared with other triplets in a pair-wise comparison
              of two domain architectures. Different events in the triplet
              comparison are scored as per a scoring scheme and an average
              pairwise distance score (Domain Architecture Distance score - DAD
              Score) is calculated between protein domains architectures. We
              use domain architectures of a selected domain termed as centric
              domain and cluster them based on DAD score. The algorithm has
              high Positive Prediction Value (PPV) with respect to the
              clustering of the sequences of selected domain architectures. A
              comparison of domain architecture based dendrograms using ADASS
              method and an existing method revealed that ADASS can classify
              proteins depending on the extent of domain architecture level
              similarity. ADASS is more relevant in cases of proteins with tiny
              domains having little contribution to the overall sequence
              similarity but contributing significantly to the overall
              function.",

              Here, we exploit that HGT creates long identical DNA sequences in
              the genomes of distant species, which can be found efficiently
              using alignment-free methods. Our pairwise analysis of 93,481

              the transfer rate between pairs of taxa. This reveals that
              long-distance HGT is frequent: our results indicate that HGT
              between species from different phyla has occurred in at least 8\%
              of the species. Finally, our results confirm that the function of
              sequences strongly impacts their transfer rate, which varies by
              more than three orders of magnitude between different functional
              categories. Overall, we provide a comprehensive view of HGT,

               sequence is a long-standing challenge in bioinformatics.
               Traditional approaches use sequence alignment to compare a query
               sequence either to thousands of models of protein families or to
               large databases of individual protein sequences. Here we
               introduce ProteInfer, which instead employs deep convolutional

               functions -- Enzyme Commission (EC) numbers and Gene Ontology

               This approach provides precise predictions which complement
               alignment-based methods, and the computational efficiency of a
               single neural network permits novel and lightweight software

              Matrix-assisted laser desorption-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) has

              heritage and sweet varieties of Zea mays. Multiple iterations of
              alignment attempts identified a set of parameters that sorted 114
              isolates into 60 coherent MALDI-TOF taxonomic units (MTUs). These

              proteasome function",
  author   = "Meng, L and Kwok, B H and Sin, N and Crews, C M",
  abstract = "Cell cycle progression requires the proteasome-mediated
              degradation of key regulatory proteins such as cyclins,
              cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, and anaphase-inhibitory
              proteins. Given the central role of the proteasome in the
              destruction of these proteins, proteasome inhibition has been
              proposed as a possible cancer therapy. We report here that
              dihydroeponemycin, an analogue of the antitumor and
              antiangiogenic natural product eponemycin, selectively targets
              the 20S proteasome. Dihydroeponemycin covalently modifies a
              subset of catalytic proteasomal subunits, binding preferentially
              to the IFN-gamma-inducible subunits LMP2 and LMP7. Moreover, the
              three major peptidolytic activities of the proteasome are
              inhibited by dihydroeponemycin at different rates. In addition,
              dihydroeponemycin-mediated proteasome inhibition induces a
              spindle-like cellular morphological change and apoptosis. These
              results validate the proteasome as a target for antitumor
              pharmacological intervention and are relevant for the design of
              novel chemotherapeutic strategies.",
